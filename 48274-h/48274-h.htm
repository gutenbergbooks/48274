<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE">PREFACE.</a></h2>

<p>The period of English history covered by the
contents of this book is one of very considerable
interest, for within that period Great Britain rose
to be a mighty power, saving Europe from destruction,
and gathering to herself the commerce
of the world. One has only to glance at a chronological
table of events to satisfy oneself that, from
1793 to 1815, the British Navy and British Army
fought continuously and desperately in the making
of the Empire, winning many great and
glorious victories by sea and by land, and handing
down to posterity the names of British sailors and
soldiers to be sworn by as long as the British
Empire shall exist. It was an age of heroic deeds
by heroic men. Let us call to mind how the Navy
fought at Cape St Vincent, Camperdown, the Nile,
Copenhagen, and Trafalgar; and how the Army
fought in the Peninsula and at Waterloo. Let
us think of the countless minor expeditions in all
parts of the world in which army and navy together
added to their laurels; of such sailors as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
Nelson, Cochrane, Collingwood, Duncan, Hood,
Hawke, Howe, Hotham, Jervis, and others, and
of such soldiers as Wellington, Moore, and all
the former's famous generals; and let us remember
that it was by such victories, won by such men,
that England gained her place in the world.</p>

<p>The stories of the lives of the great soldiers
have been written over and over again; we know
all about their strategy and their tactics, and
how they guided the machines confided to their
care; but of the lesser men, who, as it were,
helped to turn the wheels of, or to apply oil to,
the machinery, we know very little. Without
their aid the machine must have come to a
stop; and how they kept it going deserves to
be remembered.</p>

<p>Samuel Rice, extracts from many of whose letters
will be found in the following pages, was one of a
host of Englishmen who played a part&mdash;even
though it may have been an insignificant one&mdash;in
the making of the Empire. He was, in every
sense of the word, a Regimental Officer&mdash;one who
never sought and never accepted employment outside
the Regiment. Joining the 51st in 1793 as
Ensign, he served with it, in good times and in bad,
until 1831, the last fourteen years in command.
He represents a type not uncommon at the commencement
of the last century; and, at that
period, probably most regiments of the British
army contained men of the same stamp, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span>
cared nothing for personal honour or glory, who
cared little for the good or bad opinion of their
superior officers, but who lived for <span class="smcap">the Regiment</span>,
finding their reward in a conscientious performance
of regimental duty, and content to let
their own actions go unnoticed so long as they
helped to uphold the reputation of their beloved
Regiment.</p>

<p>Nowadays, such men, from force of circumstances,
are rare. The British officer can no
longer afford to remain with his regiment; for,
even if he is fortunate enough to possess sufficient
private means to do so, he can stay in the regiment
for only a limited number of years, and is
forced to make way for others when still in the
prime of life. And there are wider reasons for the
disappearance of the regimental officer of the old
school. Modern methods of warfare, resulting
from the improvement in weapons and the invention
of new means of locomotion and communication,
require deeper thought and deeper study
than was accorded to military matters by our
ancestors. It is not enough that the officer of
to-day should be acquainted only with such things
as pertain to his own branch of the service; for
he must be conversant with the tactics of all arms,
and he must know a hundred and one other things
which he cannot learn by remaining with his
regiment. Furthermore, the officer who nowadays
has no ambition beyond regimental soldiering is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
liable to be regarded as lacking in zeal and
efficiency; and if he allows himself to drift along
into the regimental backwater, he is bound to
find his progress barred before very long. But he
has advantages such as his ancestors never had.
By passing examinations he can qualify himself to
hold appointments on the staff, and he can obtain
other living-wage employment away from his
regiment. A century ago there was nothing of
this kind; examinations were little indulged in;
and it is not too much to say that the majority of
the staff officers came to the front and remained in
the front by personal (and often political) interest&mdash;by
a system of nepotism pure and simple. The
officer, therefore, who knew that he had no friend
at court to push him on made up his mind to
remain with his regiment, and trust to good
fortune to bring him rapid promotion. He
affected to despise the staff officer as a butterfly
and a place-seeker, and he threw all his heart
into his regimental duties. If proof of the value
of these regimental officers is wanting, it will be
found, writ large, in the account of every Peninsular
fight, and by the aid of these men was
Wellington's fame built up. "Their most marked
characteristics," says Colonel Henderson, when
discussing in his 'Science of War' the officers of
the Light Division regiments, "were that when
they were left alone they almost invariably did
the right thing; that they had no hesitation in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span>
assuming responsibility; that they could handle
their regiments and companies, if necessary, as
independent units; and that they consistently
applied the great principle of mutual support."
Such were the regimental officers who had received
their initial training under the guidance
of Sir John Moore, and such was Samuel Rice,
of the 51st Regiment, himself one of the earliest
disciples of that great master of the art of war.</p>

<p>By way of apology for bringing to notice a man
unknown to fame, and who had no pretensions to
be considered famous, I may, perhaps, be permitted
to explain that, in putting this book
together, my aim has been not so much to give
a biographical sketch of one individual as to
describe the lot of an ordinary regimental officer
of the period; and it seems to me that there is
no more satisfactory way of doing this than by
following the career of one officer, chosen to represent
the type. With such an object in view,
I believe that it would be difficult to find a
more suitable representative than Colonel Samuel
Rice, who served with the same regiment for
upwards of thirty-eight years&mdash;possibly in itself
a record. Moreover, he fought with his regiment
in 1793, at the very commencement of England's
great war in Europe, and he saw the final shots
fired in 1815. From what is known of his character,
it is probable that Samuel Rice would have
been the last person to have desired notoriety;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>
but his descendants have preserved, hitherto unpublished,
letters written by him one hundred and
twenty years ago, and I have thought that some
of these, showing as they do the ways of the
military world when England's reputation was
being made, are of sufficient general interest to be
worthy of publication.</p>

Rice for the loan of her great-uncle's papers, and
to the past and present officers of the King's Own
Yorkshire Light Infantry&mdash;the old 51st&mdash;for information
concerning their gallant regiment.</p>

LIFE OF A REGIMENTAL OFFICER<br />
DURING THE GREAT WAR,<br />
<span class="large">1793-1815.</span></p>

<span class="center xs">STUDYING FOR THE ARMY.</span></h2>

<p class="noindent">Samuel Rice was born at Chislehurst on the 19th
August 1775, and was the son of John Rice, one of
an old Welsh family long established at Mydfai
(Mythvey).<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> His mother was a daughter of
Samuel Plumbe, who had married the sister of
Henry Thrale, M.P., the then sole proprietor
of what subsequently became Barclay &amp; Perkins'
Brewery, and the husband of the lady who has
been named by posterity "Dr Johnson's Mrs
Thrale."</p>

<p>Being one of a family of thirteen, young Rice
was fortunate in having grandparents possessed of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
the wherewithal to give their grandchildren a start
in life, and possessed, moreover, of sufficient intelligence
to assure themselves that the money
spent on education was well laid out. It is,
perhaps, remarkable that, although very ordinary
boys at school and not above getting into scrapes,
all of John Rice's seven sons entered honourable
professions and did well. The eldest took Holy
Orders; two were in the Royal Navy; two in the
Army; and two were lawyers, one of the latter
becoming an Indian judge and receiving the
honour of knighthood. John Rice himself, who
was an only child, had been at Eton, but his sons
were educated at Cheam (Mr Gilpin's), and
Samuel, the second son, remained there until 1792,
when, as was customary in those days, he was
sent abroad to learn French before entering the
army.</p>

<p>Those were stirring times. France was in a
state of revolution, with her king and queen in
prison; a republican Government on the point
of being established, and Continental Europe up
in arms, with the hope of being able to restore
order in the country and prevent the excesses
which were likely to result from the indiscipline
of a republican army in league with the mob.
At first England maintained a strict neutrality,
and held aloof from interference with the internal
affairs of France; thus, when, in the spring of
1792, Sam Rice took up his residence at St Omer
(some twenty miles from Calais), he found the
French well-disposed towards his countrymen,
though he, the true British boy of the period,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
was disinclined to regard his new hosts otherwise
than as the natural enemies of his country.</p>

<p>In spite of the fact that he was kept hard at
work, learning not only French, but also drawing,
fencing, and dancing, he appears, from his letters
home, to have found leisure for shooting, fishing,
and riding, and he thoroughly enjoyed the change
of scene as well as the novelty of being at a tutor's
instead of at school. On this subject he wrote,
soon after his arrival in France, to his elder brother,
then at Cambridge&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"It gives me great pleasure to feel myself freed
of my leading-strings, and to be my own master,
doing what I will without being scolded and sworn
at. I am like the Frenchmen; I like Liberty;
but I think they have carried theirs too far, and
will not do well without a little more steadiness.
We find our own wine; I have bought for the
present two dozen of claret and one of Burgundy.
<em>You</em> cannot afford to drink such wine."</p></div>

<p>This matter of wine, which in those days was
considered a necessity even for a young gentleman
of barely seventeen, eventually led Sam Rice to
complain to his father about the scanty allowance
which he made him. Twenty guineas a-year for
extras, including clothes, was, he said, a ridiculously
small sum upon which to attempt to "live
as other gentlemen do"; and he summed up his
necessary annual expenses as follows: "Wine
(weak stuff), half a bottle a-day, and occasionally
giving to friends, eight guineas; washing, hairdressing,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
and hair powder, six guineas." His
appeal, however, had little effect, and on his
father's refusal to increase his allowance, the
young student cut down his wine bill in order
to have more money to spend on shooting.</p>

<p>That he benefited by his sojourn abroad is
evident from the letters which he wrote in
French to his father from time to time; and
his knowledge of the language proved of the
greatest value to him in after life. Living as
he did at St Omer, in an atmosphere of military
preparedness for war, he acquired at an early age
habits of careful observation; he learned also to
form his own opinions and to use his own judgment,
and he became imbued with the true
military spirit. His remarks on the situation
as he found it at St Omer in 1792 are of
interest&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"St Omer," he wrote, "is well fortified with
ramparts and flanked with bastions; and there
are several drawbridges before you get out of the
town, which, of course, makes it very inaccessible,
if well garrisoned. But the worst part is that
they have got such a few meagre dogs that,
I am sure, at the sight of an Austrian army they
would be glad to accept of any terms of capitulation.
To be sure there is one battalion of Swiss,
who are undoubtedly good soldiers; but I believe
that it is generally thought that they will not
fight, because the Swiss remain neutral, and they
cannot fight against the Germans, as they are
allies. The people do not seem much afraid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
of the Austrians;<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> they stump and bully now,
but when the enemy comes a little closer, I am
very much mistaken if they will not draw in
their horns."</p></div>

<p>Again, a little later, he wrote&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"There is a great preparation for war here. I
don't know how many hundred men are employed
every day in repairing the batteries, in forming
new ones, and in making new drawbridges, as well
as in cutting rivers to surround the town. All
this is done by order of General Lukener. Also
vast quantities of stores and ammunition are daily
brought into the town, and hay in abundance, for
I never walk out of the town but I meet twenty
or thirty waggon-loads of hay coming from the
country to be laid up in the town in case of want.
I heard yesterday that a party of hussars belonging
to the French had killed no less than four
hundred of the Austrian cavalry, but that General
Gouire (or some such name), a French general, was
killed. I cannot say that this is a fact; but, if it
is, most likely you will have heard of it before this
reaches you. Some gentlemen from here have
been to see the camps at Valenciennes and Lille,
and all along the side of French Flanders, which
they say are so strongly entrenched that it will be
impossible for the enemy to come into the country.
They saw ten thousand hussars pass them all at
once as they were in their carriage, and had to
wait four hours to let the cannons pass. All the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
hussars had great moustaches, which gave them a
savage appearance."</p></div>

<p>The wearing of moustaches by the French
cavalry was a new idea, and the infantry soon
adopted the same method of producing a "savage
appearance." The British soldier of the period, on
the other hand, prided himself on his clean-shaved
face, with, at the most, a suspicion of side whisker,
cut square with the line of the mouth. "Shaved
clean, and with the hair neatly tied and powdered,"
was the regulation. Moustaches were not worn in
the British army until many years after Waterloo,
and the order to wear them was received with
suspicion and dislike, being regarded as an attempt
to Frenchify the British army. It is recorded of
one famous cavalry regiment that the officers paid
no attention to the order until the inspecting
general made strong comments on their shaved
upper lips, and ordered the colonel to enforce the
moustache regulation. Within a few days each
officer appeared on parade fully equipped with a
false moustache, and this appendage was removed
when parade was over. How long this continued
is not stated, but for a long time the officers of this
particular regiment were observed to be clean
shaved when in plain clothes and heavily moustached
when in uniform. The British infantry
shaved the upper lip almost up to Crimean times.</p>

<p>But the Frenchmen's moustaches did not impress
young Rice in 1792, for he regarded the
Republican soldiers as effete and useless, and likely
to become an easy prey to the invading Austrians<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
and Prussians. His dislike for the French as a
nation was intense, and he prayed for their downfall.
"I think the French," he wrote, "a parcel
of d&mdash;d rascals, and I heartily hope the Austrians
will give them a good thrashing. We are to have
a garrison of six thousand men here, for they expect
this town to be attacked by the Austrians,
who propose to burn the place by firing red-hot
bullets, and so pass over its ashes to Brussels."
As events turned out, St Omer was not attacked,
but it was hardly the place for quiet study, and it
is wonderful that, under such circumstances, the
boy learned anything. As an experience, his seven
months' residence in France must have been full of
interest and excitement. He lived, as it were,
on the outskirts of the fight&mdash;at times with the
enemy's guns within earshot, and he constantly
saw troops marching to the front to the tune of
"Ça ira." He lived also in the midst of the
Revolution, for although St Omer itself was comparatively
quiet, the accounts which came from
Paris sickened him and filled him with righteous
indignation. In one of his letters he mentions
that he has just heard of the massacre of some
thousands of Aristocrats in Paris, and he gives
vent to his feelings in no measured terms. "The
cruelties and barbarities which have been committed
will ever be a stain upon the national
character. This French nation, which was once
the most gentle, has now by its cruelties rendered
itself the most savage and barbarous. I am now
a strong Aristocrat, and I should imagine that
people in England who favoured the Revolution<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
must have changed their opinions since the recent
horrible massacre in Paris."</p>

<p>It was, however, one thing to declare himself an
Aristocrat in a letter home, but quite another
thing to let it be known in St Omer, and he
admits sailing under false colours, in that he
wore "the cockaded tricolour, decreed by the
National Assembly." He excuses himself thus:
"If you were to appear without one, you would
be mobbed and called 'Aristocrat' by every saucy
boy in the street. So much so that one of the
actors last night at the Playhouse, during the
time he was performing, was shouted to for his
cockade, and they would not let him perform without
it. One of the others brought him one, which
he put to his breast, but that did not satisfy the
audience, for they shouted again <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à chapeau</i>, and
he was obliged to put it in his hat, to save himself
from a broken head."</p>

<p>Though Sam Rice held French revolutionary
methods in general abhorrence, he appears to
have approved of the treatment dealt out to the
religious orders, for, in describing events at St
Omer, he says: "The nuns are all going to be
turned out of their convents, and also the friars.
Most of them have been sent away, and there only
remains one church of them, from which they will
be speedily dislodged. There were twelve capital
houses with nice gardens which those rascals the
monks inhabited&mdash;one for each, and they were
allowed a considerable sum for their maintenance;
but now the people have seen what rogues they
were, and have turned them out neck and crop,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
and have sent them into the country to live upon
twelve pounds a-year. Their library and church
are turned into magazines for hay and different
stores, and all the religious houses are to be
converted into barracks for the soldiers." It is
perhaps worthy of remark that eighteen of these
persecuted Jesuit fathers of St Omer were granted,
in 1794, an asylum in England, and, bringing with
them several of their pupils, founded Stonyhurst
College, for the education of Roman Catholics.</p>

<p>As time went on, the cloud over France grew
blacker, and by the end of August the young English
student was rejoicing in the thought that the
defeat of the French army by the Allies was about
to be realised, though he gave the French credit
for offering a stubborn resistance. "The French,"
he wrote on the 28th August (1792), "now that
they have so long enjoyed their liberty, will never,
I think, submit to a despotic government, and I
believe that some would sooner blow themselves
up in their towns than capitulate. They seem
not to have the least idea that the enemy can
enter into the kingdom, but I am very much of
opinion that he will do so sooner than the French
expect, and in that event the Prussians<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> will play
the devil with them. The Duke of Brunswick in
his manifesto was very severe. He said that all
who did not submit to him, when his troops presented
themselves before the towns, would be put,
every one, to the sword, when taken; and he
wrote especially to the Parisians, against whom he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
has vowed vengeance. Three parts of the officers
of the army which was Lafayette's have deserted,
and Lukener is suspended. It was reported that
Lafayette had deserted, but it is said now that he
has been stopped in endeavouring to escape with
the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">caisse militaire</i>. In my opinion, the situation
is very bad. Longwy, a town on the frontier, is
besieged by the Prussians. If they take it (and
most probably they will), they may march straight
for Paris, as there are no other fortified towns to
obstruct their passage. Success attend them! I
long to hear of their arrival at Paris. We are
very quiet at St Omer, and most probably we
shall continue so, as the Prussians do not seem to
be inclined to make their attack on this side.
<em>Wednesday evening.</em>&mdash;I have just read in the
'Gazette' that Longwy is taken. The King of
Prussia, at the head of his army, made the attack,
and took the town in less than fifteen hours."</p>

<p>On the 7th September, just after the news of
the September massacres had reached him, he
discussed the situation again: "The Allies have
already taken two towns&mdash;Longwy and Verdun,
and there are no fortified towns between them
and Paris, but it seems to me that they cannot
reach Paris without an immense army, otherwise
they will be cut to pieces by the French armies.
They say that on Sunday and Monday two thousand
Aristocrats were massacred in Paris in the
prisons."</p>

<p>His next letter was dated October 3, and in it
he makes no mention of the brilliant victory of the
French at Valmy, where, on the 20th September,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
Kellermann defeated the Prussians under the
Duke of Brunswick, and thus gave heart to the
Republican forces. He must have known of the
victory, and he may have already referred to it
in a letter which has not been preserved, for he
seems to have begun to fear that all was not going
well with the Allies. "I make no doubt but what
you have heard," he says, "that Lille is besieged.
My father, I am afraid, will be anxious for my
safety, but I assure you as yet there is nothing
to cause anxiety; neither do I think that there
will be. It is not possible that they can take
Lille, as it is one of the strongest towns in France,
and has a garrison which is determined to hold out
to the last. They have kept up a brisk cannonading
for these two or three days past, and even here
I can hear the report of the cannons very distinctly.
Most people think that it is only a false
attack to draw off the French armies from Verdun,
where the Prussians are being kept blocked up. I
think this most probable, as they would never
attempt to attack such a place as Lille with only
20,000 men. Lille is very much damaged, as the
enemy fire red-hot balls, which, of course, have set
fire to a great many houses. Numbers of people
are saving themselves from Lille and taking shelter
in St Omer. They come, some in carriages, with
their children; others in carts, with their household
furniture; and a pitiful sight it is to see the
poor women and children reduced to such extremities.
I was up at half after five this morning to
see a regiment depart for Lille, and I was very
well amused for my pains. The soldiers seemed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
to wear a melancholy air, though they marched to
the tune of 'Ça ira,' which generally gives them
courage and consolation."</p>

<p>The postscript to this letter shows that even
an English visitor had to fall in with republican
views: "You must direct to me, '<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">A Citoien Rice,
chez Citoien Boudeille, Rue de l'Egalité, St Omer</i>,'
for you know that the title <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Monsieur</i> has been
abolished."</p>

<p>With regard to Lille (Lisle) Citizen Rice's forecast
was correct; for, on the 7th October, the
Prussians raised the siege and departed, thus
shattering Rice's hopes of a speedy occupation of
Paris by the Allies. The Duke of Brunswick's
manifesto, which he mentioned in a previous
letter, did more harm than good, as the insolence
of its tone irritated the French into deposing their
king forthwith, massacring Aristocrats wholesale
in Paris, and putting forth all their strength to
defeat the Austrians and Prussians. In this they
succeeded beyond all expectation, for the victory
of Valmy was repeated at Jemappes (November
6); and, a week later, the French entered
Brussels and occupied the Austrian Netherlands.
St Omer appears now to have settled down to
comparative quiet, and the young Englishman to
his studies and amusements; but, before the end
of the year, his father began to be anxious about
the state of affairs in France, and wrote, "the
complexion of the times is such as, in my opinion,
renders it no longer proper for a young man designed
for the British army to remain in France."
The people of England realised that the climax<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
was approaching. A revulsion of feeling against
the French had set in with the suspension of King
Louis in August; the September massacres had
increased it; and the arraignment of the unfortunate
king on December 11 raised it to boiling-point.
Neither was this all, for England saw in
the high-handed acts of the victorious Revolutionary
leaders a menace to the "rights and liberties
of Europe."</p>

<p>Sam Rice, therefore, quitted France early in
December, only a month before his return would
have been made compulsory by the French Government,
when, upon the execution of Louis XVI.
(January 21, 1793), an open rupture occurred
between England and France. His education
was now considered to be complete, and his
father set to work to obtain for him a commission
in the army.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">CHAPTER II.</a><br />
<span class="center xs">ENSIGN OF THE 51ST.</span></h2>

<p class="noindent">On the 12th February 1793 (a few days after
the declaration of war by France against England
and Holland), Samuel Rice was appointed to an
Ensigncy, by purchase, in the 51st Regiment
(2nd West York).</p>

<p>At that time, under ordinary circumstances,
young gentlemen obtained commissions in the
army in one of two ways. Free commissions
were granted to a limited number of the sons
of officers who had performed good service for
their country, and all other commissions were
purchased, upon the recommendation of two or
more officers of high rank. There were no examinations
or other means of ascertaining the
standard of education of the would-be officer,
and it may be taken that Sam Rice was better
educated than most young officers who then joined
the army. The greater number of commissions
were obtained by purchase, but in times of war,
when the supply of officers was short, colonels
of regiments were allowed to employ the services
of young gentlemen (usually ensigns of militia),
who were termed "volunteers," and who hoped,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
by distinguishing themselves on active service, to
be granted free commissions. During the many
years of war which terminated with Waterloo, a
vast number of officers entered the army in this
way, and being, for the most part, men whose
very livelihood depended upon their zeal, proved
themselves valuable officers.</p>

<p>The so-called purchase system, in one form or
another, was almost as old as the British standing
army itself, and dated back to the time when
the colonel of a regiment was entirely responsible
for his corps, which was known by his name. For
many years there was no fixed scale of charges
for commissions, the colonels charging more or
less what they liked, and employing agents to
sell the commissions, so that both the colonels
and the agents feathered their nests very satisfactorily.
In this manner many useless officers
found their way into the army, and it was not
until 1765 that the authorities took the matter
up and issued strict regulations on the subject.
Then the price to be paid to Government for a
commission as Ensign, and for promotion to each
subsequent rank, was clearly laid down, the
colonels being forbidden to make any profit for
themselves, though the matter of what was
termed "over regulation" was not touched on,
but left to the regimental officers themselves.</p>

<p>When Sam Rice entered the army he paid
£450 for his first commission as ensign in an
infantry regiment; and the regulation prices paid
to Government at that time by officers of infantry
on promotion were as follows: to lieutenant,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
£250; captain, £1100; major, £1400; lieut.-colonel,
£1300. Consequently, by the time an
officer had reached the rank of lieut.-colonel,
he had paid to Government altogether £4500.
But if he could not find the money to purchase
any step, it was open to him to purchase promotion
to the half-pay list, at a considerably
reduced price, subsequently exchanging or purchasing
back to full pay, if he desired to do so.
Eventually, on retirement, the officer received
from Government a lump sum equivalent to the
value of his commission, so that he got back the
sums which he had expended. This was termed
Retirement by the Sale of Commissions, but the
regulations varied from time to time, and later
on lieutenant-colonels were given the choice of
taking the lump sum, or of retiring on full pay.</p>

<p>The above is a brief outline of the purchase
system, in so far as transactions between officers
and the Government were concerned, but many
and various complications arose from the over-regulation
prices of commissions, with which the
Government had nothing to do. These transactions
were carried out among the officers of
the regiment, with the assistance of the regimental
agents, and the object of them was to
maintain a healthy flow of promotion by buying
out the senior officers. Death was the only other
way of displacing them, for there was no regulation
by which an officer was forced to give up
the command of a regiment after holding it for
a certain length of time, and no age limit for
any other officers. Every regiment appears to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
have had its own recognised tariff, depending
principally on the purses of the officers; thus the
over-regulation price of, say, a lieutenant-colonelcy
of a cavalry regiment was considerably higher
than that of an infantry regiment, and a lieutenant-colonel
would not retire unless the officers
junior to him subscribed the sum which he considered
his rank and appointment were worth.
In such a case the procedure would be something
as follows: the lieutenant-colonel would name his
price to the senior major, who would then see
how the amount could be made up by voluntary
subscriptions from such officers as would benefit
by the retirement of the lieutenant-colonel. The
senior major would, of course, pay the largest
amount, and the senior captain and senior lieutenant
would probably subscribe handsomely, if
they intended to purchase their respective steps.
It frequently happened, however, that officers
could not afford to purchase their promotion, in
which case a junior officer could purchase over
the heads of his seniors, the latter deciding to
wait for a death vacancy, for which no over-regulation
money was required.</p>

<p>The injustice of a system which permitted men
with money to buy their way to the front does
not seem to have struck the officers&mdash;probably
because they knew of no other system,&mdash;and its
advocates maintained that it never interfered
with the advancement of a good man, whom
the authorities were able to reward with free
promotion to half pay, or even to full pay.
Still, there can be no two opinions about a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
system which induced officers of the army to
give as a common toast, "A bloody war and a
sickly season!" The system lived long and died
hard. Its abolition was debated for thirteen
years, and even then a Bill relating to it which
was introduced in the House of Commons was
thrown out by the Lords, and purchase was only
finally swept away by a Royal Warrant of 1871,
at great expense to the Government, for compensation
had to be paid to such officers as
had subscribed over-regulation money for their
different steps.</p>

<p>However, to return to young Rice. Getting
the ensign properly outfitted caused a good deal
of trouble, and eventually he was much upset at
finding, when on the voyage to join, that his
tailor had provided him with a "plain cap"
instead of a "laced one." That was rather a
dressy age, for ever since George the Second
reorganised the uniform of the army on the
Prussian model, tight-fitting clothes, lace, frills,
and powder reigned supreme. Each year saw the
introduction of some new ornamentation wherewith
the soldier's dress was beautified; and much
more attention was paid to the smart appearance
of the men than to their professional training.
The officers, therefore, had to be very particular
about their uniform, as well as about their hair,
and strict regulations were issued from time to
time as to the mode of wearing the hair, changes
taking place every few years. In 1793, both
officers and men wore their hair powdered and
"clubbed"&mdash;<em>i.e.</em>, the long, flat, greased and pow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>dered
tail was rolled up, and bound round with
a leather strap, upon which, by way of ornament,
the officers had a rosette, and the men a small
disc of polished leather. The head-dress of the
period was a black three-cornered cocked hat,
with a black silk cockade and silver lace and
button; the full-dress coat, scarlet with grass-green
facings, was cut away in front, with tails
falling to the back of the knees; white breeches,
and black cloth gaiters; the sword hanging on
the left side from a white leather cross-belt, over
the right shoulder and under the one epaulette;
red silk sash wound round the waist, over the
waistcoat, but under the coat, and having its
tassels hanging towards the left side; a black
leather stock filling the opening in the collar of
the coat, a white starched frill beneath, and the
silver gorget, with rosettes and ribbons, hanging
at the neck. In this manner was Sam Rice
dressed when he put on his "regimentals" for
the edification of his sisters.</p>

<p>The 51st, under the command of Lieut.-Colonel
John Moore, had left England for Gibraltar in
March 1792, and young Rice, after fitting himself
out, was ordered to embark in the <i>Neptune</i> transport
at Portsmouth at the end of May 1793, and proceed
to Gibraltar with a draft for the regiment.
England was now at war with France, and the
navies of the two countries were busy sweeping
the seas. Transports were not permitted to put
to sea without the escort of a fleet, and, as often
as not, men-of-war were too much occupied to be
available for convoy duty. Consequently the un<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>fortunate
men on the <i>Neptune</i> and other transports
were kept on board in English ports for five weary
months, every day hoping that the morrow would
see the Blue Peter at the mast-head. Some of the
letters written by Sam Rice under these trying
circumstances are not without interest. Early in
June he wrote to his father from Spithead, where
the <i>Neptune</i> was lying at anchor&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"I cannot say I much admire living at Spithead,
and especially when in this state of uncertainty.
It is not at all improbable but what we shall lay
here some time longer, for I neither hear nor see
anything that is like a preparation for a convoy.
It is very unlucky for us that we lost the opportunity
of going with Lord Hood. The <i>Venus</i>,
which had an engagement with a French frigate,
came in here yesterday. I fancy, if the truth
were known, she got the worst of it, for she had
two-and-twenty men and one lieutenant killed, as
report says. By that I should think that the
action must have been very smart. I was invited
to dine on board the <i>Circe</i><a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> to-day, but could not
go, as I am the only officer in the ship. She has
taken a great many vessels, but chiefly privateers.
Three were brought in this morning, with the
British flag flying triumphant o'er the national
one of France."</p>

<p>The soldiers confined on the transports appear
to have given a good deal of trouble, and strong
measures had to be resorted to in order to maintain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
discipline. "In my last letter," wrote Ensign
Rice, "I told you that I was to sit on a Court
Martial, to be held on the <i>Granby</i> transport. The
crimes alleged against the prisoner were: impudence
to one of the officers, disobedience of
orders, and defrauding one of his messmates. I
being the youngest officer had to give first my
opinion, so sentenced him to receive 150 lashes;
the next, which was Williams, said 200, as did
all the rest. I was present at the punishment.
Two drummers were sent for from Portsmouth, to
perform. But the commanding officer, Captain
Wood, considering he was but a raw recruit, or,
I suppose, nothing but a wild Irishman, forgave
him a little less than half the number, hoping that
that would be sufficient for the present, and serve
as an example to the rest. Our men, upon the
whole, behave themselves tolerably well. We are
obliged now and then to tie them up, for fighting
or quarrelling, or suchlike things, but it is the
nature of an Irishman to be quarrelsome. We
cannot but expect it, and more especially when
there are so many together."</p></div>

<p>Writing a week later, he again referred to the
conduct of the troops on the <i>Granby</i>: "The
soldiers on board the <i>Granby</i> transport were
yesterday very rebellious, but unluckily we could
not pick out any to make an example of. These
fellows will never be orderly till they have had,
each of them, a good flogging, which, I think,
they stand a fair chance of having before they
have been many days at Gibraltar. I am very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
confident that if we were not surrounded by men-of-war,
and were to go to Gibraltar without a
convoy, we should all be murdered."</p>

<p>The references to flogging in the two last letters
must not be taken to imply that young Rice was
shaping for a martinet in this early stage of his
military career. In those days sentence of flogging
was passed on a soldier for offences which nowadays
would carry no higher punishment than a
few days' detention; and, in reading descriptions
of military and naval punishments of a century
ago, one marvels at their positive brutality. It
may be that we have finer feelings than our
ancestors had, or our natures may have become
softer, but whatever has brought about the change,
the fact remains that accounts of what took place
on an ordinary flogging parade in time of peace
make one wonder how a civilised country like
England could have permitted such barbarities.
Men were sentenced to receive so many hundred
lashes&mdash;even up to two thousand, on the bare
back, with a cat-o'-nine-tails&mdash;and the mode of
carrying the punishment into execution was as
follows: The regiment having been drawn up in
square facing inwards, and the "triangle," of solid
spars,<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> having been erected in the centre of the
square, the prisoner was marched in and ordered
to strip to the waist. He was then secured by
the wrists to the top of the triangle, and by the
thighs and ankles to the side spars. At a given<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
signal the drum-major and his drummers advanced,
and were ordered by the commanding officer to
"do their duty." The first drummer took off his
coat, and delivered twenty-five lashes, when he
was relieved by a second drummer, who delivered
the same number, the drum-major standing by
with a cane ready to strike the drummer if the
lashes were not administered with sufficient
strength. And these drummers were all trained
to the work, by flogging the fleece off a sheep's
skin, both with the right hand and with the left, so
that alternate drummers should inflict the punishment
from opposite sides of the triangle. Near
at hand stood the adjutant and the surgeon, the
former to register the number of lashes, and the
latter to observe the victim and order him to be
taken down if he thought that further punishment
at the time would endanger his life. But there
was no question of respite, for the number of
lashes awarded had to be given, if not at one time,
then at several times. Immediately the man was
taken down, he was marched to hospital, and
carefully attended to until his back had healed;
then, if he still had more lashes to come, he was
taken out again, and his back cut open afresh;
and we have it on the authority of Sir Charles
Napier, the Conqueror of Sind, that a man was
often brought to the triangle a third and a fourth
time to receive the remainder of his punishment.</p>

<p>We spare the reader further details of this
barbarous work, and we have only said so much
because it was necessary in order to show the
spirit of the times, and in order to draw attention<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
to some of the unpleasant duties of regimental
officers.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> It may be thought that corporal punishment
was rarely inflicted, but official returns prove
otherwise, and it is no exaggeration to say that,
towards the end of the eighteenth century, a
regiment on home service would parade round the
triangle at least two or three times in a month.
"In 1793," says Lord William Bentinck, "infliction
by the cat-o'-nine-tails was the ordinary and
general punishment for every offence, great and
small, only varied as to the amount according to
the different degrees of culpability, but always the
lash; except in regard to the most trivial offences,
corporal punishment was the echo in each and
every one of the Articles of War."</p>

<p>It is not difficult to understand that, under
such circumstances, recruits for the army were
slow in coming forward. Moreover, the Government
of the day neglected the soldier's comfort
and welfare in every possible way, underfeeding
him, underpaying him, and accommodating him
in vile quarters. The majority of the recruits
brought up for enlistment were produced by the
"crimps," who resorted to every mean device in
their prosperous business of catching men and
selling them to Government, and one can scarcely
wonder that such unwilling soldiers should have
resented the harsh discipline to which they were
immediately subjected. These were the men with
whom young Rice first came into contact at Portsmouth&mdash;men,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
cooped up on board ship, without
recreation of any kind, for weeks on end, and
unable even to make a bid for freedom by
desertion.</p>

<p>That there should have been a spirit of unrest
on board the transports was not very strange, but
the possibility of the disaffected troops murdering
their officers was, of course, only wild talk on the
part of a youthful subaltern. This, however, was
not a very pleasant commencement to a young
officer's service, but things seem to have settled
down as time went on, and as more military
officers joined the transports for duty. The only
excitement was that provided by the arrival of
a man-of-war, after a successful engagement. "I
saw the <i>Nymph</i>," wrote Sam Rice on the 1st July,
"as well as <i>La Cléopatre</i>, coming into the harbour.
The latter had her mizzen-mast shot away, and
was everywhere, I fancy, considerably damaged.
I have not been on board either of them; in fact,
the truth is, I have not been ashore since they came
in. The brave sons of the Republic, I understand,
fought with great courage, as did, as usual, the
sons of Old England. The French captain was
killed, or else, you may depend upon it, the
engagement would have lasted till one of them
had gone to the bottom. The <i>Phaeton</i> has taken
a very fine French ship, named <i>La Prompte</i>. She
only rates as a sloop in France, but is as big as
any of our twenty-eights."</p>

<p>In the middle of July the officers on the transports
saw a chance of sailing with the fleet under
Lord Howe, but he had other business on hand,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
and went without them. Sam expressed his disgust
at his lordship's conduct. "We thought that
we were to sail under the protection of Lord
Howe's fleet, but in that we were disappointed,
for he sailed last Sunday evening without having
the politeness to take us with him. When we
shall now sail I know not; but the report is that
it will be very soon and suddenly. It needs be so,
for they have given us a fair spell of Portsmouth.
I now know enough of a transport, which means
that I will never go in one again, if I can get my
passage in any other vessel. I almost agree with
Dr Johnson that it is as well to enter a jail as a
cabin.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> We have had a bad fever on board our
ship for some time. Two have died of it, and
many more are ill at the hospital. I should not
be surprised if we were all to take the fever, after
being so long confined in these old rusty colliers,
now in His Majesty's service for the purpose of
transporting us to Gibraltar. We are to be joined
by seven more transports, and Colonel Lindsay is
to take the command of us all. He has sent us
two thousand cartridges on board, and orders how
we are to act in case of attack by the enemy. If
one of us should be separated from our convoy,
and see a Frenchman, we are to run immediately,
and our men to be ordered to go betwixt decks.
But, if the Frenchman sails better than us, and
comes alongside, we are, with all our padding, to
board, and play hell and the devil among them&mdash;that
is to say, if possible. There has been a great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
change among the officers from ship to ship. I am
the only one left upon this ship, and consequently
am officer commandant, till a Captain Alcock, who
is appointed here, comes on board. He has got a
wife, whom he intends to take to Gibraltar with
him. I'd just as soon have the devil on board as
a woman; not that I have any natural antipathy
to women, but I assure you they are a great
nuisance, especially in such a confined place as a
cabin. You might perhaps think a lady a wonderful
acquisition to a sea party, but I am very
certain, if you had ever been <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'a voyage'">on a voyage</ins> with a
woman you would never desire it again."</p>

<p>Within the month he changed his mind about
the lady, and on August 13 he imagined that he
was within measurable distance of the end of all
his troubles. "I have just time to tell you," he
scribbled in haste, "that we have received our
orders for sailing. Our convoy fired a gun and
hoisted a signal to get under weigh immediately.
I do not suppose we shall go farther than St
Helens to-day. I came ashore this morning at
six o'clock to take leave of Old England, and to
bring on board Captain and Mrs Alcock. We
have the <i>Diadem</i>, sixty-four, and the <i>Active</i>,
frigate, for our convoy." Five days later he wrote
again from St Helens, Isle of Wight, still jubilant
at the thought that at last he had made a start
for Gibraltar, though disappointed in being kept
back by adverse winds. His letter shows how
the vagaries of the wind upset all calculations in
the days of sailing vessels, and he wrote as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"I think I never beheld a finer sight in my life
than the sailing of our fleet from Spithead. It
consisted of about seventy-five sail. The <i>Diadem</i>
led the way; and the <i>Active</i> brought up the rear.
We had made about four leagues, when, to our
great sorrow, our Commodore fired a gun as a
signal to put back to St Helens, not thinking it
prudent to put to sea, the wind not being very
favourable. The 14th, we lay at anchor. The
15th, our Commodore early in the morning fired a
gun for to get under weigh, which we immediately
did. But we were again obliged to put back to
St Helens, not being able to weather the land.
The 16th, at anchor as before. The 17th, it blew
a heavy gale, drove us from our anchorage, and
carried us down almost as far as Spithead. The
same day we were nigh being run foul of by an
Ostend vessel, which had also broken from her
anchor. I never experienced such a gale before,
and, indeed, it rather astonished the old seamen,
especially at this time of year. The wind is still
contrary. I hope we shall soon leave this disagreeable
place, which is worse than Spithead.
Captain Alcock, who, I told you, has the military
command of the <i>Neptune</i>, is really a worthy man,
and has behaved to me, since he has been on
board, with the greatest friendship and civility.
He is more like a father to me than a commanding
officer. He knows all the officers in our regiment,
and has promised to introduce me, but more
particularly to those whom he thinks it proper for
a young man to associate with. Captain Alcock's
younger brother is in my regiment, and is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
oldest captain in it; he says that his brother will
always stand my friend. I think I cannot be
better off than I am at present. I am very well
and happy in having met with such a worthy
fellow as Captain Alcock. He has not been
married above two months. His wife is a charming
and agreeable woman, and we are all very
comfortable together."</p></div>

<p>The fleet got away from St Helens on the 22nd
August, but was overtaken by another gale, and
had to run for Portland Bay, where the ships were
forced to shelter until the 8th September. By
that time the bay had become filled with ships
bound for various parts of the world, the West
India fleet of transports amongst them, and at
length the wind showed signs of being favourable
for departure. Yet, as Sam Rice's next letter
shows, luck was all against them, and a few days
later the ships turned about and anchored in
Torbay.</p>

<p>Writing from Torbay on the 17th September
he describes what had happened&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"We left Weymouth on the 8th, the wind
being in our favour. I believe never so large a
fleet sailed from that place before, or ever will
again. We were no less than two hundred sail in
number. Many were the people who assembled
to see us depart, and I do not in the least doubt
<ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'but what'">but that</ins> the sight was highly worth seeing. We
passed by this port, where we saw the Grand
Fleet lying at anchor, and we little thought then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
that we should be obliged to go in. In a very
short time we cleared the Land's End and steered
on our course for Gibraltar. We had nearly
reached the Bay of Biscay, when, to our great
surprise, a frigate came up and spoke our
Commodore, upon which a signal was made for us
all to bear homewards as fast as possible. You
may be sure we were all thunderstruck at this
uncommon proceeding, and were not a little vexed
at the thought of returning after having made so
much way. The next morning we passed by the
Scilly Islands, and from thence bore away as fast
as possible for this place, where we are safely
riding with the Grand Fleet. The frigate above
mentioned had been sent by Lord Howe, who,
having had intelligence that the French fleet was
not far off, and consisted of thirty-two sail of the
line and nine frigates, very prudently, and fortunately
for us, dispatched a frigate immediately with
orders for us to return with all possible expedition.
I was at first very much vexed at returning, but
am now rejoiced to think that we have been
fortunately saved from the rapacious claws of the
French 'Sans culottes.'<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> I hear we have taken
Toulon, with a great deal of shipping, but that we
have had bad success before Dunkirk.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> Three
regiments are gone from the garrison of Gibraltar
to Toulon; so, if any regiments go to the West
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>Indies, ours most probably will be one. Our men
are now in a sad condition; we have now three
hospital ships, and all full of men with fevers.
Several have died, and, no doubt, more will, if
they continue much longer on board a ship. It is
thought that we shall sail with Lord Howe's fleet,
but that is at present quite uncertain."</p></div>

<p>Eventually, after having put back no less than
nine times altogether, the transports succeeded in
getting away, and reached Gibraltar in November,
when Ensign Rice and his two hundred recruits
joined the 51st. He found war the one topic of
conversation, and the prospects of the regiment
proceeding on active service being freely discussed.
He learned now the true story of Toulon, which,
although actually in the occupation of a British
and allied force, had not been "taken with a
great deal of shipping," but had been peacefully
garrisoned at the request of the Royalist (or
Girondist) inhabitants. Admiral Hood, who had
brought his fleet to the Mediterranean, was
cruising up the coast from Gibraltar, when he
received a message from the Royalist Admiral at
Toulon, asking him to co-operate in the defence of
that place against the Republicans (or Jacobins),
and to hold it until the monarchy should be
restored. Hood agreed, and on the 27th August,
troops having been sent from Gibraltar, and a
Spanish squadron having joined the British fleet,
the Admiral took possession of the forts and the
many men-of-war in the harbour&mdash;amounting to
not less than one-third of the navy of France.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
He at once dismantled the ships, and removed
such of the sailors as were known to favour the
Republican cause, and he then sought assistance
from the Spanish, Neapolitan, and neighbouring
Allies who, in the course of time, sent him some
12,000 men. This mixed force, with 2000 British
troops under General O'Hara, essayed to protect
Toulon from the ravages of the Republicans, who
soon arrived&mdash;to the number of 25,000&mdash;to
besiege the place, and by November became so
active that General O'Hara sent to Gibraltar for
reinforcements.</p>

<p>The 50th and the 51st, which, for some weeks,
had been standing ready to go to the relief
of the garrison of Toulon, at once embarked
(December 5), and young Rice considered himself
in luck's way in being called upon to take the field
so soon after joining. Ill-fortune, however, still
dogged his footsteps, for the captains of the
transports delayed for three days in putting to
sea, thus losing a fair wind, so that it was not
until the 29th that the regiment arrived off
Toulon, when it learned that the place had been
evacuated in haste ten days before, the garrison
having made an unsuccessful sally, in which
General O'Hara was severely wounded and
captured. Finding that the garrison was now too
weak to hold the town against the vastly superior
numbers of the Republican forces, Lord Hood set
fire to as many as possible of the French ships in
the harbour, blew up powder and stores, successfully
embarked the British garrison, as well as
nearly 15,000 Royalists, who feared for their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
safety when the Republicans should enter the
town, and sailed for Hyères Bay<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> (a little to the
east of Toulon), where, on the 31st December,
the transports conveying the 50th and 51st joined
the fleet&mdash;to be received very coldly by the
Admiral.</p>

<p>But Lord Hood's disappointment at the lateness
of their arrival was no greater than that of the
officers of the reinforcing regiments. That Toulon
should have been abandoned, and that their
prospects of honour and glory should have been
torn from them by no fault of their own was bad
enough, but, to make matters worse, the 51st lost
all their regimental baggage and stores, including
everything belonging to the officers, which had
been placed on a separate vessel for conveyance to
Toulon. Sam Rice, a philosopher even in those
days, refers to this minor trouble very briefly.
"The officers' and the regimental baggage," he
wrote, "went into Toulon in the <i>Moselle</i> frigate,<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
which separated from the transports during the
night and did not know that the town was
evacuated, because the English flag was kept
flying. You see we military gentlemen are subject
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>to losses as well as the rest of the world." And
the loss both to officers and the men was severe,
for their colonel had been at great pains to stock
the ship with everything that the regiment could
want.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">CHAPTER III.</a><br />
<span class="center xs">THE ATTACK ON CORSICA.</span></h2>

<p class="noindent">When Sam Rice joined the 51st, Lieut.-Colonel
(afterwards Sir John) Moore had held the command
for three years, but was even then only in
his thirty-second year; for his promotion had been
rapid, and he had reached the rank of lieutenant-colonel
in the thirteenth year of his service. That
Moore was a strong man goes without saying, and
that he was a man of very exceptional talents
the world discovered subsequently. A perfect
gentleman, of unblemished character, a reliable
and zealous soldier, he was able to bring a great
influence to bear on those whom he commanded,
and he had a special gift for training young
officers. It was in this respect that Sam Rice
benefited by being appointed to a regiment with
such a commanding officer, and he learned under
Moore things which he never forgot. At that time
the condition of a regiment depended entirely
upon the commanding officer, for in the last
decade of the eighteenth century the British army
was not in a very satisfactory state. Sir Henry
Bunbury,<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> who made a study of such matters, wrote<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
sixty years afterwards: "Men of the present
generation can hardly form an idea of what the
military forces of England really were when the
great war broke out in 1793. Our army was lax
in its discipline, entirely without system, and very
weak in numbers. Each colonel of a regiment
managed it according to his own notions, or neglected
it altogether. There was no uniformity
of drill or movement, professional pride was rare,
professional knowledge still more so. The regimental
officers in those days were, as well as their
men, hard drinkers; and the latter, under a loose
discipline, were much addicted to marauding and
acts of licentious violence, which made them detested
by the people of the country."</p>

<p>It is perhaps unjust to describe the officers as
hard drinkers, if by that is meant that they were
all drunkards, or that they drank harder than did
their civilian friends and relatives. The morals
of the army were possibly no worse than the
morals of general society at that period, for it
was an age of heavy drinking, when respectable
and respected old gentlemen drank themselves
under the table every evening, and boasted of the
number of bottles of port which they could consume
at a sitting. Yet, if the opinions of Bunbury
and other writers holding somewhat similar views
of the British army in pre-Peninsular times are
to be accepted, it cannot be maintained that the
tone among the officers of ordinary regiments of
the line was of a high order. Some certainly
drank a great deal more than was good for them;
otherwise it would hardly have been necessary to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
put in print in the standing orders of a certain
regiment the caution that "the Surgeon and his
Mate must always be strictly sober." Gambling
was indulged in to an inordinate extent; and
duelling was not unknown. The fact is that the
army was suffering from long years of inaction,
and from the pernicious effects of service in
America, India, and the West Indies, where regiments
went to pieces and took years to recover
themselves. To this must be added the further
fact that the regimental officer was promoted not
by merit, but by purchase; so that it was only
necessary for a man to bide his time, and to have
sufficient money at his back to buy his steps
when they came, and in due course he commanded
his regiment, and continued to command it until
he could be bought out.</p>

<p>But, it may be asked, if such was indeed the
state of affairs, how came it that the British army
rapidly emerged from this condition of darkness
to save Europe? How came it that the hard-drinking
British officer was able to pull himself
together, and become transformed into an upright
and zealous soldier, capable of enduring endless
hardships and displaying great gallantry? The
answer is that all regiments were not bad; that
most regiments&mdash;even the bad ones&mdash;possessed
some officers of high moral character and endowed
with exceptional talents, and when war came in
1793 these officers, on the principle of the "survival
of the fittest," came to the front, and gradually
established a tone on active service which
had been impossible to uphold in times of peace.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
Some regiments possessed more of such officers
than others, and some regiments, again, chanced
to have a colonel with sufficient strength of will
to give a short shrift to any of his subordinates
who were not likely to be of value to him. As
the war progressed many of the junior, and not a
few of the senior, officers willingly or unwillingly
fell out, to make room for better men; many were
found wanting and were removed; and many had
undermined their constitutions to such an extent
that in their first campaign they were carried off
by what was commonly described as "the fever," or
the "distemper." While the weeding-out process
was at work during the last few years of the eighteenth
century, and during the opening years of the
nineteenth, the annual wastage of officers was immense;
after that, matters righted themselves.</p>

<p>Still, it is an error to suppose that the whole
army was in so bad a state in 1793 as Bunbury
would have us believe, for there are still in existence
the printed standing orders of a few regiments
of the line of about this date, and from these
there is proof enough that very great attention
was paid to the wellbeing of corps. The discipline
was strict, though of the severe and mechanical
order, and it was maintained solely by the lash;
duties in quarters were performed with the utmost
regularity; and if the standing orders were carried
out, the regiments should have been in excellent
order. It may, of course, be possible that such
regiments as had standing orders were, from this
very fact, good regiments, and that the strictures
of Bunbury and others applied to the bad regi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>ments,
which were, perhaps, more numerous than
the good ones.</p>

<p>It is, however, quite certain that when the 51st
regiment went on service in 1793, its general condition
left nothing to be desired, since Moore had
paid attention to such weeding-out of officers as was
necessary when he first took up the command in
1790, and all young officers who joined afterwards
were kept under his ever-watchful eye until he
was sure of them. "He felt that a perfect knowledge
and an exact performance of the humble, but
important duties of a subaltern officer, are the best
foundations for subsequent military fame";<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> and
he required from his officers a punctilious attention
to duty and a thorough knowledge of their profession,
so that they might be looked up to and
respected by the soldiers whom they were called
upon to command. And, a perfect gentleman
himself, he had no place in the 51st for any officer
who was not the same. He was not a martinet,
and he did not ride rough-shod over his officers
and men, but he knew exactly when the occasion
demanded a right enforcement of discipline, and
when discipline could be relaxed without detriment
to the "machine," which he proudly described, in
September 1793, as being in as good order as he
could get it.</p>

<p>So much has been said here of Colonel Moore's
characteristics,<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> because he was Sam Rice's first
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>commanding officer, and because his teachings left
their mark upon the man who served continuously
with Moore's old regiment for thirty-eight years.
To return to affairs in the Mediterranean: Colonel
Moore, as senior officer with the reinforcements
which joined Lord Hood's fleet in Hyères Bay,
immediately went on board the <i>Victory</i>, and reported
his arrival to the Admiral, who somewhat
churlishly remarked that the reinforcements were
meagre and had arrived too late to be of any use.
He forgot that the delay was due to dilatoriness
on the part of his own naval officers, and he forgot
also that had the reinforcements arrived a fortnight
earlier, they could not have prevented the
evacuation of Toulon, since, on the 16th December,
the enemy had captured the forts which dominated
the anchorage of the British fleet.</p>

<p>The Admiral was now busily engaged in working
out a plan for employing the troops on the
transports in some enterprise which, while redounding
to his own credit, would compensate
in a measure for the abandonment of the great
French arsenal; for he was aware that the evacuation
of Toulon without destroying all the French
ships, although the only step that, under the circumstances,
was possible, might be regarded in
England as a grave failure on his part. Something,
he decided, must be done at once, and that
something must take the form of providing for
the British fleet in the Mediterranean a base
deeper in than that afforded by Gibraltar, which
was at that time the only British possession in the
Mediterranean, and almost a thousand miles from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
Genoa, in the neighbourhood of which port the
French and Austrian armies were operating. Lord
Hood realised from the outset the broad principle
that, as Captain Mahan<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> says, "the policy of
Great Britain was to control the sea for the protection
of commerce, and to sustain on shore the
continental powers in the war against France&mdash;chiefly
by money, but also by naval co-operation
when feasible." Under these circumstances, the
Admiral's thoughts naturally turned to Corsica,
which, though still garrisoned by French troops,
was known to be more or less in revolt against
the Republican Government. The exact state of
affairs in the island, however, and the strength of
the French defences and garrisons, were things
about which Lord Hood had little information;
and though he regretted the necessity for delaying
the capture of Corsica, he wisely accepted, on this
occasion, the advice of the military commanders
to send two military officers to reconnoitre and
report on the practicability of making a descent on
the island. Moore and a major of artillery named
Koehler were selected for this duty, and on the
11th January (1794) left in the <i>Lowestoffe</i> frigate,
in which also sailed Sir Gilbert Elliott, one of the
King's Commissioners in the Mediterranean, who
was to endeavour to persuade the Corsican inhabitants
to assist the British force in ridding the
island of the French interlopers.</p>

<p>It is unnecessary to dwell on Corsican history
further than to say that from 1559 to 1768 the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
island was a dependency of Genoa, and that in the
latter year, contrary to the wishes of the people,
was basely sold to France. The Corsicans then
made a bid for independence, but within a few
months (1769) their army, under Pascal (or Pasquale)
Paoli, was defeated and crushed by the
Count de Vaux. It was with this Paoli, who,
after a period of exile in England, had returned to
Corsica, that Sir Gilbert Elliott opened up negotiations,
and from him, without much difficulty,
obtained the promise that the Corsicans would
aid the British in every possible way. Moore and
his companion made a careful reconnaissance of
the various French posts and forts, and on the
25th January the former returned to the Admiral
with his report. The fleet was then on its way
from Hyères Bay to the island of Elba, and in a
few days anchored off Porto Ferrajo, where it was
proposed to disembark the Royalist refugees from
Toulon and place them under the protection of
Tuscany (to whom Elba belonged), while arrangements
were being made for the leap on Corsica.</p>

<p>The story of the operations which followed, as
told by the chroniclers, is somewhat marred in the
telling by constant references to the bickerings
and petty jealousies of the naval and military
commanders, each of whom appears to have been
afraid that the rival service would obtain all the
<em>kudos</em>. Why, the reader may wonder, is it necessary
to hark back to these regrettable incidents,
which did not greatly affect the result of the
operations? Only because at one time they
threatened to destroy the reputation of John<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
Moore, Colonel of the 51st, and did actually lead
to his temporary downfall. Lord Hood, strongly
backed up by Horatio Nelson, then captain of the
<i>Agamemnon</i>, despised soldiers, and thought little
of the opinions of military officers. The naval
plan was to rush at everything, without weighing
the consequences, and the suggestions of the
General, David Dundas (who had succeeded
O'Hara), and other military officers of experience,
who counselled proceeding with caution, were
blown away, as showing weakness and want of
enterprise. Nelson himself said, "Armies go so
slow, that seamen think they never mean to get
forward; but I daresay they act on a surer principle,
though we seldom fail." Nelson was, of
course, in a measure right, but he and other
naval officers of the period failed to realise the
great difference between the facilities afforded to
the respective services&mdash;that whereas seamen
always had at their back their ship, providing
them with quarters, food, ammunition, and everything
that they required; soldiers, when once put
ashore on an expedition, had to take everything
with them and look after themselves.</p>

<p>The three principal places in Corsica held by
the French were St Fiorenzo (now St Florent) on
the north, Bastia on the east, and Calvi on the
west; and in that order Lord Hood decided to
attack each place in succession. St Fiorenzo, the
first to be dealt with, was situated at the head of
a deep bay, studded on the western shore with
detached forts, or towers, which, being constructed
of solid masonry in a circular form, deflected the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
round-shots which struck them. The most formidable
of these advanced works was the tower
of Mortella,<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> and it was impossible to attack St
Fiorenzo until these outworks had been carried.
With the object, therefore, of reducing the Mortella
Tower, Moore was ordered to land at a little
distance away, and with the 51st (numbering 350)
and a mixed force of soldiers and sailors (numbering
another 350), and with two guns, to march
inland and take the tower in rear, while the ships
bombarded it from the sea. Moore's force landed
on the night of the 7th February, and after a long
march among the mountains reached, on the following
evening, a point from which the enemy's
fortifications could be clearly examined. Moore,
who had reconnoitred them on his previous visit,
was surprised to find that the French had strengthened
their position considerably, and he came to
the conclusion that his handful of men was quite
insufficient to assail all the fortifications in front
of St Fiorenzo. He therefore sent a despatch to
General Dundas, and reported that to attack with
any prospect of success would require all the
General's available troops.</p>

<p>That day was spent in getting the guns into
position and in a further reconnaissance, while two
ships bombarded the Mortella redoubt, though
without breaching it. The ships, moreover, were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
set on fire by the enemy's hot shot, and were
forced to sheer off, with a loss of some sixty men.
On the next day more guns were mounted on land,
but although they did little damage to the solid
tower, their fire made it impossible for the enemy
to show himself or reply, and the French officer in
command, seeing that he could no nothing, surrendered.
The next outwork to be disposed of
was the Convention redoubt, and this gave a good
deal of trouble. Moore, who was still conducting
operations on land, inspected the ground with
General Dundas and Major Koehler, and discovered
an excellent artillery position, from which
it would be possible to batter the Convention.
The difficulty was to get the guns up the steep,
rocky hill, but, with the aid of a party of seamen
with tackle, two 18-pounders and a howitzer were
mounted within the next few days, and a mortar
and some other guns were placed on a more accessible
position, when the enemy's redoubt was subjected
to a heavy cannonade for two days. Moore
had now with him only the 51st, but on the 17th
February the General gave him orders for the
assault that night. The Royals were to join the
51st, and Moore was to assail the front of the
redoubt, while the other British regiments and
the Corsicans were to deliver simultaneous assaults
on either flank.</p>

<p>Moore decided to attack in column of companies,
the first company consisting of the grenadiers and
light infantry<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> of the Royals, the second of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
grenadiers of the 51st, the third of the light
company of the 51st, then the battalion of the
Royals (only sufficient to make five companies),
then three companies of the 51st. The other five
companies of the 51st followed in rear as a support;
and in rear again came 130 sailors, under
Captain Cooke, with entrenching tools.</p>

<p>At 8.30 <span class="xs">P.M.</span>, by the light of a brilliant moon,
Moore led the advance, which for a quarter of a
mile could only be made in file. After a little he
reached a spot open enough to form up the column;
the enemy's piquets fired a few shots, as they
realised what was taking place; and Moore immediately
ordered his column to push on. When
within fifty yards of the redoubt, they found
themselves in a slight hollow, unexposed to the
enemy's fire, and here Moore halted them for a
few seconds preparatory to the final uphill rush.
A moment later the Royals and the 51st leaped
into the head of the work, and crossed bayonets
with the Frenchmen, who stood their ground gallantly
and fought with desperation. Eventually,
however, the flank attacks pushed in and overwhelmed
the defenders, though in the darkness it
was difficult to distinguish friend from foe, and, to
add to the confusion, the enemy holding the neighbouring
redoubt of Fornali began to open with
grape-shot upon the victorious British. But before
midnight the latter had entrenched themselves,
and within an hour it was learned that the French
had abandoned Fornali.</p>

<p>Arrangements were now made for the attack on
St Fiorenzo itself, but before they had been com<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>pleted
the enemy withdrew from the place and
retired to the fortified town of Bastia, situated on
the east coast of Corsica, and barely ten miles
across the neck of the peninsula from St Fiorenzo.</p>

<p>The coast near Bastia was quite open, and the
town was not fortified on that side; elsewhere,
however, it was defended by four detached redoubts
and a citadel placed on heights at a little
distance inland. On February 23, Moore and
General Dundas went across the mountains to
reconnoitre the enemy's position, and on the following
day the 51st and 69th advanced to within
a mile and a quarter of the French piquets, who
were heard throughout the night digging entrenchments
for their further security on the ground
which it was necessary for the British to occupy
in order to capture Bastia from the land side.
Becoming aware of this, General Dundas, in the
morning, ordered Moore to withdraw his force, and,
to the surprise and disappointment of every one,
the withdrawal took place. Moore at first imagined
that the General's idea was to perfect arrangements
before delivering the assault, but after a
while he discovered that, in spite of Lord Hood's
constant request for co-operation from the land
forces, General Dundas had refused to attempt the
capture of the town with the small force under his
command. This was a bitter discovery for Moore,
who was longing to lead his regiment to the front,
but he concealed his disappointment, as he considered
that it would be "a species of mutiny for
a subordinate officer to pass any opinion" on the
action of his General.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>Lord Hood, never on good terms with General
Dundas, now brought matters to a head by sending
a somewhat extraordinary letter, in which he
said that upon the evacuation of Toulon the
General's command had practically ended, and
that he (Lord Hood) was in supreme command
of both the fleet and the army. The General
replied with calmness that, unless the Admiral
could produce his commission from the King,
neither he nor his officers would acknowledge his
pretensions to the command of the land forces.
But Lord Hood's letter probably had the result
which he desired, for on the following day General
Dundas, on the grounds of ill health, gave up the
command, and having appointed the next senior
officer, Colonel D'Aubant, a brigadier-general, and
given him the temporary command of the army,
left for England on the 11th March. D'Aubant
proved himself a useless commander, and being
averse to an assault on Bastia, threw cold water
on every plan laid before him. In vain did Lord
Hood urge the necessity for an attempt being
made by the land forces; and, after holding
several councils of war, he at length declared
that he would take Bastia with the marines<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> and
sailors. Already a month had been wasted in
looking at the place&mdash;a month which gave the
enemy leisure to perfect his fortifications and
entrenchments. Almost another month passed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
before Bastia fell; and its fall was brought about
not by assault or bombardment, but by starvation,
resulting from Lord Hood's careful blockade
from the sea and the Corsicans' watchfulness on
land. There had been practically no fighting,
and though Hood and Nelson dignified the operations
with the name of siege, the army was never
in position, and all that was undertaken by the
ships was the maintenance of a strict blockade,
and the landing of some guns and a fighting force
under Nelson. The guns did little damage to the
enemy or his works, thus wasting much valuable
ammunition, and the force commanded by Nelson
(consisting of 1183 soldiers acting as marines on
board ship and 250 sailors) made no advance. On
the 19th May Bastia was starved into surrender,
and the 3500 men of the garrison gave up their
arms to the British combined forces, which numbered
no more than 3000 soldiers and sailors.</p>

<p>Attention was now directed to Calvi (on the
west coast of Corsica), the only place of importance
remaining in the possession of the French.
It was known that they had been busy for some
time victualling the place for a siege, and Lord
Hood determined to operate before the garrison
of Calvi could be further reinforced. Brigadier-General
D'Aubant had gone home, on being
relieved by General Charles Stuart, who had been
sent out from England to succeed General Dundas,
an appointment which met with the approval of
every one and which gave confidence to the troops.
The regiments in Corsica, though seven in number,
were miserably weak, as they were required to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
furnish detachments for duty as marines on board
the ships, and the climate had begun to tell on
the health of the men. General Stuart's "army,"
available for operations against Calvi, consisted,
therefore, of no more than 2300 men. These
troops were conveyed in transports from Bastia
to Mortella Bay, and, on the 19th June, after a
further voyage, disembarked a few miles from
Calvi, and marched inland to a camp on the
high ground some three miles from the fortress.
Colonel Moore was given the command of a
special "corps of reserve," consisting of the
"flank companies of the Royal Irish, 50th, and
51st, and the remains of the 2nd Battalion
of the Royals," so the command of the 51st
devolved, for the time being, on Major Pringle.
Two outworks of considerable strength lay in
front, <em>i.e.</em>, on the land side, of Calvi&mdash;viz., the
Fort of Mozzello and the fortified rock of Monteciesco.
Batteries were immediately thrown up
on commanding heights, about 500 yards from
these outworks, and on the 7th July the enemy
evacuated Monteciesco. The guns now turned
on Mozzello, and for ten days endeavoured to
make a practicable breach, the assailants suffering
the whole time from the fire from Calvi itself
and from some minor outworks, and Captain
Nelson, who was present, unfortunately losing an
eye, from splinters of stone being flung into his
face by a round-shot striking the ground in front
of him.</p>

<p>Before daylight on the morning of the 19th
July, a breach having been effected in the walls<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
of the Mozzello redoubt, the troops moved forward
to the assault. Colonel Moore led the stormers,
some of whom carried sandbags, and others
ladders. Shot, hand-grenades, and live shells
were hurtled down upon them by the defenders,
but, nothing daunted, the grenadiers charged
forward, and plying their bayonets with vigour,
drove the Frenchmen out of the redoubt. In
this desperate encounter Moore was wounded in
the head by a splinter of a shell, but though
knocked senseless for a moment, he continued to
lead his men until he made certain that the place
had been secured, and that entrenchments had
been thrown up to cover the troops from the
fire of the enemy's guns in Calvi.</p>

<p>With the capture of the Mozzello redoubt,
however, the enemy's resistance virtually came
to an end, and his guns ceased to fire. Yet the
Frenchmen refused to capitulate, and the British
prosecuted the siege with vigour, pushing forward
new batteries and mounting upwards of thirty
pieces of ordnance. Moore wrote at the time:
"The men and officers fall ill daily; considerably
more than a third of our force are in the sick
report; perhaps there never was so much work
done by so few men in the same space of time."<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>
By the 30th July the enemy began to consider
the matter of terms, as Calvi had been set on
fire in two or three places, and the British guns
were doing much damage. After this General
Stuart stopped all firing, while he entered into
negotiations with General Casabianca; and on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
the 10th August Calvi surrendered, the defenders
laying down their arms and forthwith embarking
on transports.</p>

<p>Young Rice, as a very junior subaltern in the
51st, of course had no opportunity of distinguishing
himself in these operations, and he does not
appear to have been much impressed by his first
campaign. On the 2nd August 1794 he wrote to his
father from "Camp before Calvi," as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"A flag of truce having just gone in, or rather
hoisted in the town by the enemy, and being not
so much distracted by shot and shell, I embrace
the opportunity (which I may say with truth is
almost the only one I have had since the commencement
of the siege) of writing these few lines.
Do not expect now, when I begin, that I am going
to give you minute details of all our operations
here. In the first place, it would not be in my
power, and, in the next, they would be very uninteresting.
The papers will in all probability soon
show the fate of Calvi and the operations before
it. They are, in my opinion, better able to provide
news of that nature than are private letters.
The most satisfactory news, I imagine, to you will
be that of my health and safety. The flag of
truce above mentioned will in all probability terminate
in the capitulation of Calvi, which I am
extremely glad to think likely, not on account
of the danger of shot and shell, but on account
of the great sickness from which both officers and
men are suffering. The disease, which is a fever,
not only happens to the most delicate, but seizes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
in the most sudden manner on the most robust
and healthy. We have now out of our army
upwards of 2000 lying in fevers, and a great
number of officers. It is not very dangerous,
but two officers have died of it. In my opinion,
the disease arises from our having to lie in the
trenches exposed to the intense heat of the sun.
I am quite tired of the siege. We have taken
all the enemy's outposts and silenced all his guns,
and the town has been in flames for some days.
If they continue stubborn, the General is determined
to hearken to no more flags of truce, as
he has so often been humbugged by them before;
but to batter a breach and enter the town by
storm, which will be easily effected, though perhaps
not without a few broken heads. As yet
only four officers have been killed, and six or
seven wounded. Colonel Moore was slightly
wounded on the head at the storming of the
Mozzello redoubt, but is now, I am happy to say,
quite recovered. An unfortunate shot killed an
officer<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> of ours the day before yesterday in the
trenches. He had only just joined, and was an
excellent young fellow, and is much lamented.</p>

<p>"I would thank you to tell Mr Greenwood<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>
to write to Colonel Moore, as is customary, about
my promotion; for until that time I do not take
the rank of lieutenant in the regiment.</p>

<p>"I was at the taking of Bastia, though did not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>reap many laurels there. All I can say is that
we were ready to do anything that there was to
be done. My Lord Hood and his marines claimed
the honour&mdash;if there was any&mdash;of taking that
town. Bastia is a very good town, and will make
very pleasant quarters. Calvi is to appearance
no great things. Ajaccio is much the pleasantest
place in the whole island.</p>

<p>"<em>August 4th.</em>&mdash;My lieutenancy was this day
noted to the regiment&mdash;the commission dated 1st
April. We have not yet taken possession of the
town, but are pretty certain the business is at
an end. The General has not thought fit to
divulge the great secret.</p>

<p>"<em>August 11th.</em>&mdash;The enemy marched out of
Calvi yesterday with the honours of war, and
embarked on board transports for conveyance to
Toulon. The town of Calvi is in a deplorable
state."</p></div>


<p>Sir John Moore's Diary bears out this last
statement. "It is inconceivable," he wrote, "the
destruction our fire has occasioned; there is literally
not a house which has not been damaged by
shot or shell. The whole is a heap of ruins."
Moore also often lamented the sickness from which
the troops suffered, but an entry made in his Diary
of the 16th August shows that Sam Rice's regiment
was better off than most. "The 51st," said
Moore, "have fewer sick than any other regiment,
owing undoubtedly to our surgeon, M'Cleish, who
is a diligent and intelligent man; but also, in a
great degree, to the good regulation of our regi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>mental
hospital for these three or four years past.
This was one of the first things to which I
attended on getting the command of the regiment.
It has remained in good order ever since
then. I am now rewarded by having three times
the number of duty men of <em>any regiment here</em>."<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p>The cause of all this sickness among the troops
was undoubtedly exposure, for there appears to
have been no epidemic of any kind, and modern
soldiers under similar circumstances would probably
suffer equally. In the daytime the men
lay out continuously beneath the fierce heat of a
Mediterranean summer's sun, and their dress was
that worn in England in the winter&mdash;viz., tight-fitting
cloth clothes, with their "clubbed" hair
beneath a hat which, if anything, made their
heads the hotter. At night they slept out, almost
uncovered, among the mountains, at a temperature
sometimes so low as almost to freeze the
very marrow in their bones. That sunstroke and
sun fever should have fallen upon them was little
to be wondered at.</p>

<span class="center xs">CORSICA WON AND LOST.</span></h2>

<p class="noindent">With the capture of Calvi French resistance in
Corsica came to an end, and the island became
a British possession, the Corsicans, some two
months earlier, having declared their allegiance
to the King of England. Sir Charles Stuart at
once began the distribution of his troops in garrisons
about the island, and the 51st sailed from
Calvi on the 19th August, going round to Bastia,
of which place they were to form the garrison.
Writing from Bastia on the 11th September, Sam
Rice gives some account of events:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"I have the pleasure of telling you that we
have quitted our canvas houses, and have taken
up our quarters in this garrison, which is by no
means an unpleasant one. How long we shall
continue here is very uncertain at present, as
there are other places in the island which must
be garrisoned. Our regiment will very probably
go to Ajaccio, which is, by all accounts, one of
the pleasantest and most healthy places in the
whole island. General Stuart, Colonel Moore, and
some others of the great men set out, about a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
week ago, to take a tour of the island, for the
purpose, I suppose, of finding out what places it
will be necessary to garrison. The French, I hear,
are making great preparations at Toulon, to endeavour
to retake the island. I hope they will
make the attempt, when we will give them a
warm reception.</p>

<p>"In the letter which I wrote to you after the
surrender of Calvi, I think I mentioned the extreme
sickness of our army. It was nothing then
to what it is now. You will be astonished when I
tell you that the 51st Regiment was almost 500
strong at the commencement of the siege of Calvi,
but now, I am sorry to say, we have not a hundred
fit for duty. The rest of the regiments are in the
same way. The 12th Light Dragoons, who have
had no fatigue, suffer alike from this shocking and
unwholesome climate. The Corsicans say that,
after this month is over, the climate will be very
healthy until July. It is to be hoped so, else I
am certain that in the course of three months
we shall not have an English soldier in the island,
if they continue to die as they have done for this
some time past. The officers have suffered just as
much as the men. I am the only officer of the
regiment who has not been sick, and how I have
weathered it so long is to me astonishing. In the
conquest of this island we have suffered little by
the sword, but sickness has played the devil.
This is a subject too shocking to dwell upon,
though we are so habituated to hear of deaths,
that the death of a man is scarcely more noticed
than that of a fly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>"I forgot to tell you that we left Calvi the
19th August&mdash;my birthday&mdash;and embarked on
board transports for this place, which is not above
a day's sail with a good wind, but we unfortunately
were kept nearly a week at sea. I believe
I never gave you an account of Bastia; indeed
I don't know whether I can, further than that
it is a large and populous place, and resembles
very much the generality of French towns. We
are very much crowded here with French refugees
who came from Toulon, so much so that the officers
cannot get lodgings, which I think a great
hardship after having been so long in the field.
I have been employed since I have been here in
recruiting my kit, which was rather the worse
for campaigning. My bedding and cot I had the
misfortune to lose the first week I was in Corsica,
which was, I think, the greatest misfortune that
could happen to a man, except the loss of his
head. My softest bed for many months was the
ground, with one blanket (which I purchased) to
cover me. It was not really cold, so it did not
much signify. You used to tell me what a lazy
life a soldier's was. I don't know how it is, but I
have not yet found it so, without you call lying
in one's clothes for three or four months together,
mounting out-pickets, and all such pleasant amusements
being lazy. I assure you that the little
service I have seen here has done me a great deal
of good, and has shown me that there are more
rough things than smooth in life.</p>

<p>"We are going to be very gay here. An Italian
Opera is shortly to open, which is to be patronised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
by the Governor, and is much approved of by the
garrison. A coffee-house for English papers is also
to be established, which I think a much better
thing than the former. In fact, you do not know
how grand we are going to be.</p>

<p>"The <i>Moselle</i> frigate, which, as I told you, went
into Toulon with all our baggage and was captured,
fell into our possession again coming out of
Calvi, but the 'Sans culottes' took care that we
should have none of our things with her. I shall
come in for some prize-money for Calvi. Two fine
frigates were taken with the town&mdash;<i>La Melpomonie</i>
and <i>La Mignonne</i>, which, it is to be hoped,
will fetch some cash."</p></div>

<p>This letter and the following one give some idea
of the life of a subaltern in a marching regiment
on foreign service in 1794, and for that reason are
not without interest. They deal little with politics,
because such matters did not concern a junior
lieutenant in the army who had sufficient to occupy
his time in looking after the welfare of his men,
and in performing the ordinary routine duties of
his regiment and of the garrison. And it may
be taken as certain that a subaltern in Moore's
regiment did not have much idle time.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<br />
<p class="xs right">"<span class="smcap">Bastia</span>, <em>October 21, 1794</em>.</p>

<p>"Since my last, Sir Gilbert Elliott has been
appointed Viceroy of the extensive kingdom of
Corsica, on account of which the municipality gave
a Ball to the officers of the garrison and inhabit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>ants.
It was 'perfect liberty and equality,' for
I believe such a mixture of people never was
seen at any assembly whatever. The supper induced
a great many of the poor Toulon emigrants,
of whom there are numbers here, to go. Without
exaggerating, they eat more voraciously and in
a more unchristianlike manner than any pack
of hounds I ever saw. It was certainly the most
beastly sight I ever beheld, though at the same
time the most laughable. Some pulling fowls into
pieces with their hands; others legs and shoulders
of mutton, and many pocketing. In short, it was
the most complete scramble that I ever saw, or,
I believe, ever was seen. Colonel Hely, of the
11th, gave the garrison a Ball last week, which
was done in a very genteel manner. General
Stuart gives one to-night, which, I daresay, will
excel them all in brilliancy. He is a very gentlemanlike,
pleasant man.</p>

<p>"Sir Gilbert Elliott went yesterday to Corte,
where he is going to stay a few months, and then
returns to Bastia. Corte is distant about five-and-forty
miles from here, and is the place where
the Corsican parliament is held. There is an excellent
road all the way to it, which was made
at considerable expense by the French. I cannot
give you any account of the country, as I have
seen so little of it. Those who have been round
the island, and in the internal parts, do not speak
very favourably of it. I am sorry I cannot tell
you our troops get much better, though it is to
be hoped that they soon will, as the weather
begins to get cold and consequently more favour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>able
to their complaints, which are chiefly the
fever and ague. We continue daily to bury a
great number of men, and I am afraid we shall
for this some time to come. It is a shocking
sight to go round the different hospitals, which
are crowded with patients. It is a duty which
we have frequently to do, and which, you may
conceive, is not a very pleasant one, though at
the same time very necessary.</p>

<p>"Poor Tourle of our regiment has been extremely
ill ever since we left Calvi, and has just
gone, with another captain of ours, to the internal
parts of the country for the recovery of their
healths. Most of the officers who have had this
complaint have gone over to Italy, which is no
doubt the best place, the climate being so favourable.
We cannot muster above a hundred and
fifty men fit for duty now, and I am afraid it
will be some time before we can call ourselves
a regiment again. The 12th Regiment of Light
Dragoons embarked here for England the other
day, and sailed with Lord Hood, who is also
going home. The French fleet still continues to
be blocked up by us. What will be the event
of the blockade is not in my power to tell. Some
pretend to say that the French left Toulon through
policy. It no doubt keeps that port open. I can
scarcely imagine that that was their intention,
but leave it to more able politicians than myself
to judge. By the last accounts from the Continent,
we heard that a general action was daily
expected. What will be the result of it we are
anxious to hear. Our loss in the West Indies,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
I see by the papers, has been very considerable
both by the sword and by sickness. The French
appear to still keep a very strong post in Guadaloupe,
and before it is taken much blood will
be shed, I imagine."</p></div>

<p>This letter contains two items of public interest&mdash;viz.,
that Sir Gilbert Elliott had been appointed
Viceroy of Corsica, and that Admiral Lord Hood
had sailed for England. To the subaltern Sir
Gilbert's appointment and Lord Hood's departure
meant little; to his colonel, who was behind the
scenes, they meant a good deal; and to General
Stuart they meant still more. It was the beginning
of the end, and the end was the loss of
Corsica to Great Britain. The veteran Admiral,
who had already passed his seventieth year, resigned,
ostensibly because England refused to send
him the reinforcements for which he asked,<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> but
in reality because he had had a "personal quarrel
with Lord Spencer, then the head of the Admiralty."<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>
Accustomed to carry all before him,
and to win victory after victory, he became the
idol of the people, and in the eyes of the navy
he remained for many years the very essence of
a fighting sailor who could do no wrong. His
vanity was flattered, and, as he advanced in years,
he began to consider himself infallible, refusing to
listen to any advice which did not fall in with
his own views. We have seen how he treated
General Dundas and his successor General Stuart,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>and, although it is evident that he was well acquainted
with Moore's worth, his pride forbade
him to acknowledge that any soldier could help
him. With Sir Gilbert Elliott, as a pure civilian,
his relations had always been different. Each
knew that the other's good word would carry
weight in England, and each showed an equal
contempt for the opinions of soldiers. Sir Gilbert
had lived on board the <i>Victory</i> with the Admiral
for some months prior to his appointment as Viceroy,
and had acquired the greatest admiration
for the gallant sailor, who doubtless impressed
upon the future Viceroy the importance of forming
judgments for himself and not listening to
the suggestions of the military commanders.</p>

<p>With the departure of Lord Hood, the navy
ceased to be interested in Corsican affairs, so all
cause for rivalry between the two services came to
an end. A new rivalry, however, at once arose.
Sir Gilbert, as Viceroy, became an autocrat, and
although the exact terms of his commission had
not yet been made known to him, he took a leaf
out of Lord Hood's book, and informed General
Stuart that he considered himself Commander-in-Chief.
The General, however, was not the man
to quietly accept a subordinate position in the
force with which he had completed the conquest
of Corsica, and he politely gave Sir Gilbert to
understand that he intended to retain the command
of the troops until the Viceroy should receive
the King's commission authorising him to assume
the functions of Commander-in-Chief, when he
would be prepared to hand over the command.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
Sir Gilbert was content to bide his time, but
friction, of course, was inevitable, since, without
a complete understanding between the heads of
the civil and the military departments, it was impossible
to establish any proper form of government
in a newly acquired British possession. Moore's
position is a little difficult to understand, as at
that time he held no appointment other than that
of Lieut.-Colonel commanding the 51st Regiment,
although he had been recommended for the post
of Adjutant-General, in place of Sir J. St Clair,
who was going home. Yet all along Moore was
General Stuart's right-hand man, and to all intents
and purposes acted as his chief staff officer. Consequently,
he upheld his General in everything
that he did, and resolved to stand or fall with
him. And the fall eventually came, though not
for some months.</p>

<p>In the meantime the troops were moved about
and garrisons established at various places, while
three battalions of Corsicans were raised for home
defence. The 51st continued to garrison Bastia
until the end of the year, and from that place Sam
Rice, on the 28th December (1794) wrote to his
father as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"I am sorry to tell you that, since my last, we
have had the misfortune to lose poor Captain
Tourle,<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> who died a martyr to the complaint of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
this climate. He was the handsomest and most
healthy man I ever saw. No regiment, I believe,
ever lost so worthy a fellow, both as an officer and
man; nor was any one ever more regretted. He
was buried with all military pomp, attended by the
two generals and all the officers of the garrison.
We have still two or three officers ill, but not
dangerously so. The nature of the climate is such
that, if once attacked, a person is subject to
relapses. What is very singular is that the inhabitants
throughout the country are subject to
the same complaint, which carries off numbers of
them. There was a report the other day that the
French fleet was off Ajaccio, but it was unfounded.
Admiral Hotham's fleet is at Leghorn, and is daily
expected at St Fiorenzo. We expect to march in
a few days for Corte, to take up our quarters there.
It is by all accounts a wretched place, but we are
all happy at the thoughts of anything for a change.
There are three Corsican battalions raised here. If
they are to be drilled as our soldiers are, to stand
the charge, which I suppose they are, I do not
know how they will behave, as their manner of
fighting is what we call bush-fighting&mdash;that is, to
take a steady aim upon any one from behind a
bush or tree,&mdash;in short, from any place from which
the man can fire without being seen.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> I see that
there is a talk of peace. I am afraid that, if we
make peace, we must resign the West India Islands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
and perhaps the famous island of Corsica, which
will be a great loss to Government.</p>

<p>"If I have made many blunders in this letter, I
ascribe it all to a pretty Corse, who has been
chatting to me all the time from the opposite
window."</p></div>

<p>In the first week of January 1795, Sir Gilbert
Elliott received despatches from home, giving him
supreme command of the army in Corsica. Thereupon
General Stuart resigned, and at the same
time General Trigge was appointed by the Viceroy
to command the troops, and Colonel Moore was
put in orders as Adjutant-General, though, before
taking up the appointment, he took the 51st to
Corte and settled the regiment in its new quarters.
Grave fears of a French descent on Corsica soon
began to be entertained, and the defence of the
island against a strong invading force gave the
military authorities cause for apprehension. The
British fleet in the neighbouring waters was still,
however, of sufficient strength to give a measure
of confidence to the sister service on shore, and if
there were jealousies when the army and the navy
were employed together, they were forgotten by
the soldiers when they heard of the sailors' victories
at sea. At any rate, so much may be gained
from the following letter, written by Sam Rice
from Corte on the 28th March 1795:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"What has been passing in this part of the
world for this last month is certainly worth relating,
but how to do it I am certainly much at a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
loss. I will begin with Admiral Hotham's engagement
with the French fleet, but of course all I
know of the business is from hearsay. I can give
you no days or dates, for when the French fleet
came out and when ours attacked I know not,
except that it all happened. A few days ago the
French fleet appeared off Cape Corso, which did
not a little alarm us, particularly as our fleet was
not then in the Bay of St Fiorenzo. We concluded,
of course, that a descent was intended,
which was really the case. However, the Viceroy
immediately sent an express in an open boat to
Admiral Hotham, who was then with the fleet at
Leghorn, and the next morning our fleet was in
sight. The French still kept in the same place,
drawn up in <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ligne de bataille</i>, and seemed resolved
to meet us&mdash;like true Republicans, to conquer or
perish in the attempt. Our fleet, coming up, soon
made a change in the business, for the French set
off as fast as possible, and we after them with a
favourable wind. As the French ran, the fight
could not be general, and, I believe, would not
have taken place at all had not the <i>Inconstant</i>
frigate&mdash;a remarkably fast sailer&mdash;borne down
upon the French and engaged a 74, whereupon the
French Admiral ordered two other 74's to her
relief. By that time the <i>Illustrious</i> and <i>Courageux</i>&mdash;two
of our 74's&mdash;came up and engaged
the <i>Ça Ira</i> and <i>Censeur</i>, and I believe as desperate
an action as ever was fought ensued. The French
ships at last were obliged to strike, but not before
having seven hundred men killed on board one of
their ships alone. The <i>Courageux</i> lost all her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
masts, and the other was considerably damaged.
Those, I believe, were the only ships which came
into action; the rest made the best of their way
to Toulon, it is supposed, excepting the <i>Sans
Culottes</i>, a first rate, who was obliged to put into
Genoa, with the loss of her masts, carried away
in a gale of wind which came on soon after the
engagement. The intention of the French fleet in
coming out of Toulon was to proceed immediately
to Corsica, to enter the Bay of St Fiorenzo, to land
ten thousand troops, cut out of the harbour four
sail of the line (which they had been informed
Admiral Hotham had left behind), and then set
off with them. The scheme was excellent, but,
fortunately for us, it did not succeed, for it would
have given them a complete superiority by sea,
and probably we all should have been made
prisoners of war, as it would have been impossible,
I should think, for us to have defended ourselves
with so small a force of British as we have in
the island. The French having troops on board
accounts for the number of men who were killed
on the <i>Ça Ira</i>.</p>

<p>"Since I began my letter an express is arrived
from Bastia with the news that, after the dispersion
of the French fleet, five sail of the line fell
into the hands of the Spanish fleet, which was
coming from Carthagena to our assistance. This
news is generally supposed to be authentic, which
I hope may be the case. I forgot to mention to
you before that the <i>Berwick</i>, a 74 of ours, who,
I think I told you in my last, had rolled her masts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
overboard in a gale of wind, was going from St
Fiorenzo to Leghorn to be repaired, when, unfortunately,
she fell in with the French fleet off Cape
Corso, and was taken. She, notwithstanding,
made a very gallant action, in which her captain
was killed. Our fleet is now in Porto Spezia, not
far, I believe, from Genoa."</p></div>

<p>The details of the fight described above are substantially
correct, though the engagement was
carried on for two days, and the bulk of the fighting
was done by the <i>Agamemnon</i> (Captain Nelson).
Undoubtedly, by this action Admiral Hotham
saved Corsica for the time being, but his victory
was not as complete as it might have been, or
would have been, if Nelson had been in command
of the fleet. The latter recognised the necessity
for staking everything on the destruction of the
French fleet there and then, and endeavoured in
vain to persuade the Admiral to pursue and prevent
the enemy from reaching Toulon. Hotham's
contentment at the result of the engagement bore
fatal fruit, for the French ships which escaped to
Toulon soon refitted, and having been joined on
the 4th April by some ten others from Brest,
formed a very powerful fleet, and became a
serious menace to the small British garrison
of Corsica, at the best of times not strong
enough to resist invasion, and now much reduced
by sickness. About this time the 51st
lost another officer, and Rice inveighs against the
climate again:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"I am sorry to tell you," he writes, "that we
have had the misfortune to lose Captain Alcock<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>
of our regiment, who departed this life, like poor
Tourle, a martyr to the complaint of this cursed
climate. He had been but a short time ill at
Bastia, from whence he went to Leghorn for the
recovery of his health, but on his first landing
was seized with a violent fever, which carried him
off in the course of a few days, in spite of the
faculty. You may recollect my mentioning both
him and his brother&mdash;the latter who was so civil
to me on coming from England, and the former
on my joining the regiment. Thus (in Alcock and
Tourle) we have lost two of the worthiest, gentlemanlike,
and handsomest men that ever any regiment
possessed&mdash;the one captain of grenadiers,
the other of light infantry. They were both great
friends of Colonel Moore's, and, in short, of all the
officers.</p>

<p>"We still continue to be very sickly in our regiment,
having above one hundred privates sick in
the hospital, and an equal proportion of officers,
for of the latter we have here five sick in the
hospital, one in Italy, two gone home for the
recovery of their healths, two dead, and several
others who have had a lucky escape from death.
What great acquisition this island can be to the
Crown of Great Britain I leave to abler politicians
than myself to determine. It certainly has a
tolerable bay for our shipping, and that is all. It
has been a fine burying-ground for the British<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
this last year, and if we continue during this next
year to bury in the same proportion, I am afraid
that the air will become more pestilential than
it naturally is. In the time of the Romans this
place was well known for its insalubrity, and the
banishment of a criminal to Corsica was thought
sufficient punishment. We expect Colonel Moore
here daily, who is coming for change of air, he
having been likewise ill."</p></div>

<p>Soon after this it appears to have gradually
dawned on even the regimental officers that the
defences of the island were not in too satisfactory
a condition. Moore, who was indefatigable in
touring the country, knew that the coast-line was
open everywhere, and that the towns were
defenceless. The Viceroy, generally optimistic,
at times suffered from panic, and went so far as to
consult the military authorities on the state of the
defences and how they could be improved. He
had his own views, however, on the subject, and
as they differed entirely from those of the
Adjutant-General, little, if any, improvement took
place. Moreover, intrigue was at work among the
Corsicans, many of whom already doubted if
British rule was any better than French. How
much the "man in the street," otherwise the
regimental subaltern, knew of what was going on
is shown by the following letter from Sam
Rice:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<br />
<p class="xs right">"<span class="smcap">Bastia</span>, <em>May 2, 1795</em>.</p>

<p>"I marched here about a fortnight ago with
a detachment to assist in doing duty in this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
garrison. How long I shall stay here I cannot
say. The number of French prisoners that we
have in different parts of the island makes the
duty hard, as they must, of course, be guarded.
I went yesterday with a party to fetch above a
hundred of them from near Fiorenzo, and brought
them here the same day. They behave themselves
very well at present, but should the French fleet
appear off the coast I don't know what they
may do.</p>

<p>"A report prevails here that the French have
received a reinforcement from Brest of six sail of
the line. If such is the case I think we shall not
long remain in the island. The French have a
great party here, who would immediately join
them in the event of a descent, and those who are
now of our party would, I daresay, be better paid
by the French, and so abandon us&mdash;such is the
character of the Corsicans. If we may believe the
French, they will not come here; they say that
they are a nation too polished to ever think of so
barbarous a country as Corsica. Barbarous as it
is, I daresay they would be glad to chase us from
it; not that it would be of any value to them, but,
as long as we are here, they will be ever jealous,
and indeed, in my opinion, very naturally so. We
have orders to hold ourselves in readiness to take
the field. Provisions and ammunition are constantly
going to the interior of the country, in
case of a retreat. Do not be surprised if my next
is from some camp among the mountains. I send
this by Captain St George, who takes home the
Viceroy's despatches."</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>From this letter it would seem that the
existence of two political parties among the
Corsicans was a matter of common knowledge,
and it would seem also to have been generally
known that one party favoured the French and
the other the English. How the strings were
pulled was probably only known to a very few
Englishmen; possibly only to the Viceroy and
Moore. Yet the puppets, placed upon the stage,
played gaily to the audience for a while, then
snapped their strings and played without them.
From the beginning the Viceroy's methods had
been distasteful to the people, and their beloved
Paoli, the Corsican patriot, endeavoured to hint as
much to Sir Gilbert, who, however, took the hint
as unwarrantable interference. From that time
the Viceroy became distrustful of Paoli, and set
up, in opposition to him, one Pozzo di Borgo, a
man versed in intrigue, of few scruples, and hated
by the Corsicans, who, though they continued to
be loyal to the British Government, distrusted the
influence which Pozzo had over the Viceroy. Had
Sir Gilbert kept in with Paoli, and governed
through him, all might have gone well. Instead,
as Sir J. F. Maurice<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> puts it, he attempted to
apply the British Constitution to a people to
whom it was unsuited, and, in doing so, he used as
his instrument a worthless man, who had not the
confidence of the people. Now, Moore was a
personal friend of Paoli, and the Viceroy knew it,
and he suspected Moore of intriguing against him,
though, had he been a judge of character, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
would have known that Moore was always too
straightforward and outspoken to be capable of
intrigue. Yet, believing that Moore was disloyal,
he took the step which any man so placed would
take. Not being an Oriental potentate, he did
not have his enemy quietly poisoned off, but he
wrote home and asked for his removal, and Moore
was, in September 1795, ordered to quit the
island within forty-eight hours. On the 4th
October Moore visited the 51st at Corte and
shook the dust of Corsica from off his feet. After
his departure the plot thickened, and in the early
months of 1796 matters began to assume an
uncomfortable attitude; disaffection among the
people grew rife; and Paoli, in despair, went to
England. From bad, things then went rapidly
to worse, and the following letter from Sam Rice
shows how, by the middle of the year, Corsican
affairs were already approaching a crisis.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<br />
<p class="xs right">"<span class="smcap">Bastia</span>, <em>June 27, 1796</em>.</p>

<p>"Our correspondence, I am afraid, will, every
day now, become more uncertain and of course
less frequent, owing to the French having overrun
so great a part of Italy, and the rapid progress
which they are still making. Our last news from
Leghorn was that the Republicans were within a
very few hours' march of that place; if so, the
communication by that part of Italy will be entirely
at an end. An officer from this garrison,
who is going to England, and who will be the
bearer of this, in order to be certain of avoiding
the French, sets out this evening for Civita<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
Vecchia, a seaport near Rome, and from thence
will cross the Roman territories to some place on
the Adriatic coast, whence he will take a vessel
for Venice.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p>"I have the pleasure to tell you that the
Regiment left Corte the beginning of this month.
After what I have told you of that place in former
letters, you may imagine that none of us regretted
leaving it and its polite and agreeable people.
Since my last, things in Corsica have been in a
very disagreeable situation. The cause of the
discontent of the Corsicans was first owing to the
taxes, which they thought too oppressive. That
discontent was not then by any means general,
only some few villages refusing to pay by force of
arms, but they were soon compelled by a party of
our garrison from Corte. The last and most
serious revolt happened about twenty miles from
Corte, at a place called Bagnano. The Viceroy
determined to put an end to such hostile acts, and
came in person to Corte to give energy to the
business. He was attended by a numerous suite
of the most respectable people of the island, and
also by a number of British and foreign troops.
The troops from Bastia were joined by our
grenadier company and light infantry company,
to which latter I have the honour of belonging.
When everything was ready for the campaign we
marched for the revolted country, our army consisting
of near five thousand men&mdash;British,
foreigners, and natives. The first impediment we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
met with was a fort, on a very commanding
situation, built in the time of the French. The
Corsicans, who were in possession of it, refusing to
submit at discretion, the troops were immediately
ordered to surround it. Our two companies
marched directly up to the fort and kept a very
hot fire of musketry on it for some time, but,
finding it impossible to scale the walls, we were
obliged to retire, with the loss of our too brave
captain of grenadiers, four privates killed and five
wounded. It is since said that poor Shawe,<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> who
was the person that fell, had no such orders as he
was attempting to carry out. Whether he had or
not it is now impossible to say. When anything
fails the blame is generally cast on the sufferer.</p>

<p>"No sooner had this unfortunate business
happened than the news came from Corte that
the town and foundry of that place were surrounded
by natives, and that they were determined
to cut off the Viceroy and the army, upon which
we were immediately ordered to retreat on Corte.
This rebel army was now so formidable near Corte,
and so determined, that their chief sent word to
the Viceroy that if he would not redress their
grievances he should be under the necessity of
doing it himself by force of arms, or something to
that purpose. The Viceroy, wishing to spare
blood, granted them nearly, I believe, what they
wanted, which was the dismissal of his Corsican
minister and some other men who had become
odious to the people. The short and long of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
business is that the people, not approving of the
Viceroy's choice of his ministers and people about
him, took the opportunity I before mentioned of
forcing him to act in a different manner. What
was first thought to be the revolt of a few villages
has ended in that of nearly the whole country.
Things are at present pretty quiet, but there is
still a very considerable republican party in the
island, and it is said that the French have landed
a great many arms here, and have sent over
officers to incite the people against us.</p>

<p>"I have the pleasure to tell you that I am now
oldest lieutenant. If a vacancy should happen I
would not wish to purchase, as it is very probable,
if I have good luck, that I shall get on without,
particularly as the war is not yet at an end."</p></div>

<p>Little did Rice think when he despatched this
letter that within four months he and his
regiment, together with the remainder of the
British troops, the Viceroy and his staff of civilian
officials, would be driven from Corsica. Yet
during these four months events happened swiftly,
and a combination of circumstances&mdash;many quite
unforeseen&mdash;overwhelmed the Viceroy. He himself
for a long while had been extremely unpopular
with the people, who were for the most part in
open rebellion. Napoleon Buonaparte was carrying
all before him on the Continent, and the accounts
of his many victories filled with admiration
the minds not only of the French "emigrants,"
but also of the Corsicans themselves, who gloried
in the knowledge that the conqueror was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
Corsican. Then Spain, previously leagued with
the other powers against the French Republic,
basely deserted and went over to the enemy. As
soon as this was known in England, the British
Government, fearing the worst, and aware that
the British fleet in the Mediterranean was not
equal to the combined Spanish and French fleets,
decided forthwith to withdraw all the troops from
the Mediterranean, and sent instructions to Sir
Gilbert Elliott to evacuate Corsica.</p>

<p>But before this, the Viceroy, on hearing of the
capture of Leghorn by Napoleon, had despatched
Nelson to occupy the Isle of Elba, where he established
a small force as a safeguard to Corsica, and
he now proposed to withdraw altogether from the
latter island, and assemble the troops at Porto
Ferrajo, in Elba, preliminary to carrying out his
orders to remove the troops from the Mediterranean.
Nelson, on the 14th October, brought
the British fleet to Bastia, for the purpose of conveying
the troops to Elba, and he arrived only
in the nick of time, for he found the garrison hard-pressed,
the French "emigrants" and the Corsicans
having surrounded the citadel, to which the
garrison had withdrawn, and demanded its surrender.
Bastia itself was also in the hands of
rioters, who had seized British property and
threatened to make a prisoner of the Viceroy.
Nelson at once rose to the occasion, and checked
the riot by training his guns on the town, at the
same time sending a message on shore to say that
he was prepared to bombard the place and utterly
destroy it. The embarkation of the troops then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
commenced, but took some time, and on the 18th,
when the evacuation was nearing completion, news
came that the French had landed near Cape Corso
and were marching on Bastia. The guns were
hastily spiked, but only just in time, for the last
boat-load of soldiers had barely left the shore,
on the 20th, before the French advanced guard
marched into the citadel of Bastia. The dignified
withdrawal suggested by the British Government
resolved itself, therefore, into a somewhat undignified
flight, and, but for the timely arrival of
Nelson's fleet, worse things might have happened&mdash;possibly
an ignominious surrender.</p>

<p>The embarkation of all the troops without the
loss of a single man, albeit that a gale of wind
was blowing at the time, was a very fine performance;
and the excitement was increased by the
knowledge that the Spanish fleet was bearing
down upon Corsica, and could not be distant more
than twelve leagues. Yet Nelson took the fleet
safely to Elba, and there disembarked the troops.</p>

<p>Thus was Corsica lost to Great Britain. "It
was impolitic," says Southey,<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> "to annex this
island to the British dominions, but, having done
so, it was disgraceful thus to abandon it. The
disgrace would have been spared, and every advantage
which could have been derived from the
possession of the island secured, if the people had
at first been left to form a government for themselves,
and protected by us in the enjoyment of
their independence." As things turned out, it is
doubtful if any good resulted from the occupation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
of Corsica, beyond that, for a period, it may have
been useful to the British fleet in the Mediterranean,
although it provided no facilities for refitting
or repairing damaged ships. Of the evils
produced by the conquest and possession of the
island, enough perhaps has been said. For a time,
at any rate, the reputations of Hood, Dundas,<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>
Stuart, and Moore were sullied; the Corsicans
suffered oppression, hardships, and punishment for
rebellion; Paoli, the Corsican patriot, retired to
England, and died there in exile;<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> England's fair
name was dragged in the dust, and many of
England's soldiers found graves in the island.
Only two men came off with flying colours: the
ex-Viceroy, Sir Gilbert Elliott, was raised to the
peerage, and Nelson added glory to his name.</p>

<span class="center xs">FROM THE MEDITERRANEAN TO CEYLON.</span></h2>

<p class="noindent">The island of Elba, where the troops had taken
refuge, belonged to Tuscany, which, with other
Austrian and Italian states, was allied with
Great Britain against the French Revolutionists.
Tuscany, however, was too weak to withstand the
French invasion, and had already lost Leghorn.
For a time, therefore, it became doubtful whether
the British force in Elba would be able to obtain
sufficient provisions from the mainland close to
the island, as there was always the danger of the
French cutting off the supplies, and Elba itself had
few resources. To make certain that the troops
should not starve, it was decided to despatch a
small expedition to the mainland, to dislodge the
French from Piombino and the neighbourhood,
and keep the communications open. This was
satisfactorily carried out in November (1796) by
Colonel Wemyss and a column consisting principally
of the Royal Irish Regiment, and Piombino
was held by the British for the next three months
without being troubled by the French. Pure good
fortune saved the troops, both on the mainland
and in Elba, at this time, for before the end of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
year the British fleet was withdrawn from the
Mediterranean, and, had the French chosen, they
could have captured the force left behind without
much difficulty.</p>

<p>Sam Rice's letters during this eventful period
were few, probably because there was no possibility
of sending them home, but in the spring of
1797 he succeeded in getting a letter through.
He wrote as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<br />
<p class="xs right">"<span class="smcap">Porto Ferrajo, Isle of Elba</span>,</p>
<p class="xs right padr2"><em>March 22, 1797</em>.</p>

<p>"The <i>Fox</i> cutter, which arrived here the other
day from Sir John Jervis, with the famous and
glorious news of the Spanish fleet being defeated,<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>
sails to-morrow for Gibraltar. There is no news
whatever to tell you from this quarter. The
French, so near neighbours, are very peaceably
inclined towards us, for they have not even paid
us a visit, which they might very easily have
done, and to our great annoyance. The most
unfriendly thing that they have done since we
have been here was to stop about two hundred
fat bullocks, which were coming for the use of
the army. Our troops being withdrawn from the
cantonment<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> was the cause of that. The French
have resumed their old posts,<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> and if we stay here
much longer, we must take them a second time.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>

<p>"We are all heartily tired of this place; there is
not an amusement of any kind; it is badly supplied
with provisions, and everything at an exorbitant
price. We unfortunate subalterns can
scarce live. Our pay barely finds a good breakfast.
These are the pleasures incident to a
military life. We are as much in the dark as
ever about our destination. Various are the
reports. Some are of opinion that we are to go
back to Corsica; others that we shall go to
Portugal. The latter, I hope."</p></div>

<p>It seemed as if the authorities had forgotten
the existence of the small force at Elba. "But
neither Jervis nor Nelson forgot that a detachment
of the British army was marooned in a little
island off the coast of Tuscany, in imminent danger
of capture by the French, and soon after the great
naval victory off Cape St Vincent, Nelson dashed
back into the Mediterranean, ascertained that de
Burgh and his troops were safe, and conveyed
them safely to Gibraltar."<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> So, within a few
weeks of the date of Sam Rice's last letter from
Elba, he and his regiment were on the way back
to the Rock, and the evacuation of the Mediterranean
was complete. That any one should have
thought that there was a possibility of the troops
from Elba reoccupying Corsica at this juncture
shows how little was known of the situation and
of the intentions of the British Government. The
idea of going to Portugal had more in it, and Sam
Rice's hopes were shortly to be realised.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>
<p>What Captain Mahan calls the "Warfare
against Commerce" had now set in with a
vengeance. To put the matter briefly: Napoleon,
already practically master of Continental Europe,
aimed at being master of the world, but found
himself held in check by Great Britain and her
fleet. To destroy the power of Great Britain,
therefore, became his immediate object, and he
knew that the only means of bringing this about
was by the destruction of her commerce with the
world. From England, he swore, the commerce of
the world should pass to France; but England
was prepared not only to hold her own, but also
to wrest from France her little all. The English
nation was determined that even if the resources
of the country were drained to the last dregs, the
despot of Europe should be held in check, and as
time went on many a financial crisis threatened,
so that only by the most strenuous efforts was it
found possible to provide the sinews of war.
Fortunately, at this time the people of England
were patriotic to the core, and they raised large
sums of money as "Voluntary Contributions,"
which they presented to Government for the
purpose of carrying on the war, only ceasing to
subscribe voluntarily when, in 1798, the Government
introduced the Income Tax, and declined
free gifts of money.</p>

<p>Napoleon began by ordering the maritime
powers of Europe to close their ports to British
trading vessels; and England at once replied that
she would cut off all trade between the Continent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
and the outside world; that only through England
should there be any trade at all. Such was the
condition of affairs when the troops from Elba
arrived at Gibraltar in the spring of 1797. Spain
had now become the mere catspaw of France, who
dictated to her on all occasions, and the two
powers set to work to coerce Portugal into joining
them, threatening the occupation of Lisbon by a
French force if Portugal should refuse to close her
ports to English ships. Portugal, observing the
heavy combination against her, and the removal
of the buffer between herself and France, almost
forgot her ancient alliance with England; but,
remembering it before she had committed herself,
she rejected the Franco-Spanish overtures, declared
herself for England, and armed to resist
invasion. To support her in her brave resolve
England sent Sir Charles Stuart and a body of
troops to Lisbon, and, in June 1797, the 51st
proceeded from Gibraltar to join that force. But
although Napoleon, smarting under the insult
offered to the Republic of France, desired above
all things to bring Portugal to her knees, he was
too deeply involved in other parts of Europe to
be able to spare troops sufficient to carry out his
threat of marching on Lisbon. The British force
in occupation, therefore, was not called upon,
during the next fifteen months, to do anything
more than ordinary garrison duty, which, according
to Sam Rice, was uninteresting to a degree,
though the Portuguese did their best to show
hospitality to their allies, and though Rice's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
younger brother, Henry, came into Lisbon in his
ship on more than one occasion, and helped Sam
to make merry.</p>

<p>In June 1798, Rice, with less than six years'
service, was promoted captain in the 51st, and
given the command of the light infantry company&mdash;a
much coveted post. But, as he had been
for some years a light infantry lieutenant, it was
natural that he should have the command of the
company, which happened to become vacant at the
opportune moment. As we have already said, the
grenadier and light companies of regiments were
composed of picked officers and men, who wore
uniforms different from the rest of the regiment.
In the case of the light infantry company the
hair was not "clubbed," and the head-dress consisted
of a leather cap&mdash;almost a skull-cap, with
a large round peak straight up in front. The red
jacket worn was quite short, and the gaiters were
much shorter than those of other companies. The
officers and sergeants were armed with fusils, and
wore pouches; so light infantry officers had silver
epaulettes on both shoulders, the sword-belt being
held in place by the one and the pouch-belt by the
other. And upon the epaulettes, as well as upon
the cross-belt plate, was worn the light infantry
badge&mdash;a silver bugle-horn. A distinctive uniform
of any kind always carries great weight, and
doubtless the light company officers held their
heads high, though they had some reason for doing
so, since they knew that on active service their
place was with the vanguard&mdash;in the forefront of
the fight. But their daily pay was no higher than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
that of their brother officers of the battalion companies&mdash;viz.,
captain, 9s. 5d., and lieutenant,
5s. 8d. And they could not complain, for a
lieutenant-colonel received no more than 15s. 11d.,
and a major 14s. 1d.&mdash;cheap enough food for
powder!</p>

<p>While the 51st were eating out their hearts
in inaction at Lisbon, the British Navy was
doing splendid work, sweeping the seas in every
direction, capturing French merchant vessels,
and protecting British commerce. Then Napoleon,
seeking new fields for conquest, suddenly
bethought him of Egypt, and forthwith transported
thirty thousand men across the Mediterranean
for the enterprise; but Nelson, following him,
utterly destroyed the French fleet in those seas
at the battle of the Nile, on the 1st August
1798. After this serious defeat, there appeared
to be little prospect of Napoleon being able to
carry out his threat of marching on Lisbon, and
the 51st began to speculate about their future
movements, having little doubt that they would
be sent either to the West Indies or to the East
Indies. In each quarter there was every prospect
of fighting, for the West India Islands had been
the scene of much conflict of recent years, their
commercial value being considerable, and their
possession being, consequently, of great importance.
In the East Indies, also, much was doing;
the East India Company was still struggling for
supremacy over the native rulers; the great
Mahratta war was being waged with vigour; and
operations in the Carnatic were not yet at an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
end. To develop the trade of the East Indies
was at this time of vital consequence to England,
and since the insignificant French possessions in
India (Chandernagore and Pondicherry) had
already been captured, British trade had no
competitors in that part of the world. It was
necessary, however, to strengthen British rule in
the country by reinforcing the land forces; and
it was necessary also to keep open the long
trade route between India and England by means
of the Navy. The convoy system was by this
time in excellent working order, and all British
merchant vessels sailed under escort of men-of-war.
It will be remembered that as far back as
1793 Sam Rice described in some of his earlier
letters how large numbers of merchant ships
assembled at Portsmouth to be convoyed to their
destinations, and how the ship in which he sailed
to Gibraltar was one of a fleet of two hundred.
But besides these convoys, the various trading
routes were patrolled by frigates and sloops-of-war,
ever on the look-out for the enemy's cruisers
or merchantmen. So by the one means or the
other British ships were given a possibility of
security, though occasionally a venturesome
merchant, to whom time meant money, refused to
wait for a convoy, and sent his ship to sea
without one, as often as not to be captured. In
1798 Government decided to put a stop to these
risky proceedings, and passed an Act making a
convoy compulsory for every British merchantman.
The East India Company at this time possessed a
fleet of magnificent merchant vessels, and armed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
with guns; but they always sailed in a body with
a convoy of men-of-war, and, considering the time
taken in collecting a sufficient number of ships for
a convoy, the service was fairly regular. As a
rule, the convoy was relieved at St Helena, men-of-war
from the Indian station being responsible
for the eastern half of the voyage, and the meeting
of the outward and homeward bound fleets at the
little island was, from all accounts, a fine sight.</p>

<p>It was to the East Indies that the 51st eventually
received orders to move, because news had
reached England that some of the native rulers
were leaguing themselves with the French to oust
the British, and in October 1798 the regiment
embarked at Lisbon, joined the fleet of East
Indiamen, and sailed for St Helena. In January
they put in at the Cape of Good Hope, and the
following letter, written by Sam Rice, from that
place, shows that the voyage had not been without
incident:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<br />
<p class="xs right">"<span class="smcap">Cape Town, South Africa</span>,</p>
<p class="xs right padr2"><em>January 26, 1799</em>.</p>

<p>"Had not our water failed, I should not have
had the pleasure of sending you these few lines,
it being the positive order for the Commodore not
to touch anywhere, except <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en cas de besoin</i>. We
arrived here three weeks ago after a passage of
twelve weeks. Nothing material happened, only
that one of the large Indiamen ran foul of us in
the night and carried away part of our stern. I
never was so frightened in my life. I thought
that it was certainly all over with us. You can
form no idea of the shock. Seamen think nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
of these things, but as for me, who am not a
seaman and have no wish to be, I am in constant
fear. Soon after our arrival we received orders
to disembark, and to remain until such time as a
reinforcement should arrive. I am happy to say
that yesterday orders were issued for a re-embarkation.
Our heavy baggage goes on board
to-morrow; I imagine we shall do so the day
after. The General, whose name is Dundas, reviewed
us the other morning, and was highly
pleased with our appearance, and not without
reason. We no doubt are, for our numbers, <em>the
prettiest and best-disciplined regiment in the
Service</em>. You will excuse my mentioning it."</p></div>

<p>Here we see the true regimental officer's pride
in his corps. The spirit which Moore had created
in his officers still lived&mdash;to the 51st officer no
regiment was equal to the 51st,&mdash;and without
such a feeling, which was by no means universal
in those days, a regiment was of little real value.
That the 51st was in as good order as the officers
thought is vouched for by General Dundas's Inspection
Report, which is still in existence.</p>

<p>The presence of a British general and British
troops at Capetown in 1799 is worthy of comment,
because no part of South Africa belonged to Great
Britain at that time, and Capetown was not
actually captured by the British, to hold for their
own, until 1806,<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> and not acknowledged as a
British possession until 1814. The reason was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
this: In 1794 the Cape had been for many years
in the possession of the Dutch East India Company,
whose rights no other Europeans disputed,
and at the end of that year the French overran
the Netherlands, the Hereditary Stadtholder, the
Prince of Orange, taking refuge in England.
Fearing that the French would proceed against
the Dutch colonies, the Prince thought of his
alliance with Great Britain and Prussia, and
forthwith (February 1795) sent to the Dutch
Governor of the Cape a despatch, ordering him
to admit into the colony any British troops which
might be sent, in order that they might protect
the Dutch possession from a French invasion.
This despatch was conveyed to the Cape by a
British fleet, carrying British troops, but the
Governor, knowing that the Netherlands had become
a Republic and had joined France, refused
to accept the orders of the exiled Stadtholder.
The British General's position was a peculiar one;
he had been ordered by his Government to occupy
Capetown as a friendly measure, but this the
Dutch Governor declined to allow him to do. A
month was spent in negotiations, and when these
failed, General Craig took matters into his own
hand, occupying Simonstown, and declaring his
intention of carrying out his orders. The Dutch
flew to arms, and expressed their determination
to resist the unwarrantable intrusion, but in
August were driven out of the position which
they had taken up. In the following month a
reinforcement of three thousand British soldiers
joined General Craig, and against these heavy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
odds the Dutch could do little, so that the
occupation of Capetown on the 16th September became
an easy matter. From that time until 1803
the British held the Cape, nominally for the
Dutch, but in reality for Great Britain; but by
the Peace of Amiens, signed in March 1802, it
was restored to the Dutch, with the proviso that
the English East India Company could use it as
a place of call.</p>

<p>In April 1799 the 51st disembarked at Madras,
and took up quarters in Fort St George. Southern
India (or the Carnatic, as it was then usually called),
which, for some years past, had been in a state
of unrest, owing to the tyranny of the notorious
Tippoo of Mysore, was still the scene of military
operations, but the 51st arrived just too late to
take part in the great victory at Seringapatam,
where, on the 4th May, the British force stormed
and captured Tippoo's stronghold, annihilated the
Mysore army, and killed the infamous ruler himself.
After that the country gradually settled
down to comparative quiet, and the British troops,
no longer required for keeping order, were free for
employment elsewhere, the 51st receiving orders
for Ceylon.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The homeward-bound fleet leaves the Roads
to-morrow," wrote Sam Rice, from Fort St George,
Madras, on the 9th August 1799. "The mail is
ordered to be made up this evening. Only one
ship has left this coast for England since our
arrival, which was with the news of the capture
of Seringapatam. I was then with a detachment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
up the country, and did not know of her sailing,
which accounts for my not having written before.</p>

<p>"I am sorry to say that we were not fortunate
enough to share the honours with the conquerors of
Mysore and divide with them the immense treasure
of the tyrant in his capital. It is at least two
thousand pounds out of my pocket, besides the
chance of plunder&mdash;and being a flank company
officer would have assisted me. It cannot be
helped; better fortune another time. By the last
news from Europe, this part of the world is likely
to be the quietest for some time to come. The
war seems only to be just begun; the fate of
England and of Europe in general must soon
be determined. We embarked for Colombo, in
Ceylon, soon after our arrival here. After cruising
in the Bay for three weeks, and beating against
the monsoon in vain, we were at length compelled
to put back, with half our men sick. Our loss has
been very great, and the Regiment is still very
sickly. It is yet thought that, when the monsoon
shifts, we shall again attempt Colombo. I cannot
give you a favourable account of India; the climate
is so hot that, in my opinion, no real pleasure
can be enjoyed; but this is always the cry of a
newcomer; time and necessity may reconcile me
to it."</p></div>

<p>Sam Rice's occasional references to prize-money
and plunder sound nowadays very mercenary in
a British officer, but a century ago such things
added zest to the soldier's life, for, it must be remembered,
rewards were for the few, and medals<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
only for the most senior of the officers. Though
plunder was not regarded as legitimate, prize-money
was quite in order and regulated by Government.
Everything taken from the enemy was
sold by Government, and the amount realised was
divided among the troops engaged, according to
rank, so that, in the case of big captures, even
a private soldier often received as much as £100;
at Seringapatam, for instance, more than a million
of money was divided amongst the troops, who,
moreover, pillaged freely on their own account.
Eventually, but not until after the middle of the
nineteenth century, prize-money came to be considered
degrading to the spirit of the British
soldier, who, it was thought, should have higher
motives for doing his duty. Moreover, the distribution
of prize-money to a part of the army,
because that part happened to make a fortunate
capture, was certainly unjust to the remainder of
the army who might have had an equally hard
time, though with less luck. Consequently, it
was decided to substitute for prize-money a regulated
rate of field-service allowance to all officers
and men engaged in a campaign, and captures
from the enemy became the property of Government.
Private plunder, as a relic of barbarism,
was generally denounced, and was often dealt
with as a crime for which the punishment was
death, yet, even in the Peninsular War, it went
on to a great extent, and was at times openly
winked at. And the Peninsular War cannot be
said to have seen the last of open plunder, as
witness the sacking of the Summer Palace in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
1860, and somewhat similar, though perhaps less
open, incidents up to forty years later. Apart
from the moral aspect of the question, plundering
by an army is, of course, subversive of all
discipline, as men once given over to plunder
become irreclaimably out of hand. It has to be
dealt with drastically&mdash;no other means can check it;
for it is a curious psychological fact that, even in
this present age of civilisation, men whose morals
are above suspicion, and who under ordinary circumstances
would not dream of misappropriating
the smallest portion of another man's property,
regard the property of the absent enemy as fair
loot. The man's arguments are simple ones: if
he did not take the thing, some one else would
do so; when the enemy fled he abandoned all
his possessions; and findings are keepings. All
said and done, nations themselves have not
always set the best example; and some of the
art treasures of Europe have changed hands more
than once as a result of conquest.</p>

<p>It was not until February 1800 that the 51st
again embarked for the voyage to Ceylon, having
in the meanwhile returned to garrison duty at St
Thomas' Mount and at Fort St George, and on
its departure the Governor-General of Madras,
Lord Clive, issued a special valedictory order,
in which he remarked on the splendid state of
the regiment and its excellent discipline. Landing
at Trincomalee three days after leaving
Madras, the regiment encamped there for a week,
and then went on again, by sea, to Colombo, at
which place it eked out, for nearly two years,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
an extremely dull garrison existence, as may be
gathered from the following extract from a letter
written by Captain Rice at Colombo, on the 26th
July 1800:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Our stay at Trincomalee was not long. This
is by far the best place in the island, but, although
it is surrounded by cinnamon gardens and many
other fine things, I cannot say much in its favour.
It is something cooler than the coast of India;
existence may be endured; but there is no society
whatever. It is most probable that our Regiment
will remain some time on this island,&mdash;I am afraid
longer than we wish. Everything here is very expensive,
owing to the difficulty of getting supplies
from the coast (India), which can only be done in
the particular seasons. A secret expedition has
lately been fitted out at Madras. Part has already
sailed with H.M.'s 10th Regiment. We
are always left out; better luck, I hope, for the
future. Little is stirring in the country since
the fall of the Mysorean tyrant, nor do I think
there will be for some time to come. A Mahratta
war was talked of, but I believe they are too wise."</p></div>

<p>Ceylon, when the 51st went there, had two
principal British settlements on the coast&mdash;Trincomalee
and Colombo, which had been captured
from the Dutch as recently as 1796.<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> The British
were also in possession of, or at any rate ha<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>d
control over, such a depth of coast-line all round
the island as could be dominated by ships' guns.
The remainder of the island was ruled over by
an independent chief, with whom the Dutch had
attempted to form treaties of friendship, and whom
likewise the British approached. This chief, the
King of Kandy, however, disliked, and had the
strongest suspicions of the motives of, all Europeans,
and was, moreover, inflated with a sense
of his own importance, so the overtures of the
British Governor came to naught. On the death
of the King of Kandy in 1798, trouble arose concerning
the succession to the throne, which was
usurped by a stranger without any pretensions.
Plots and counterplots ensued among the Kandians,
and after a while one of the parties endeavoured
to enlist the services of the British, to
establish order. The Governor refused to interfere
in the internal affairs of the Kandians, and
nothing of particular importance occurred until
1802, when some native traders from British territory
were ill-treated and robbed by the Kandians,
and redress for the outrage being refused, Governor
North decided to march on Kandy.</p>

<p>Although Kandy was no great distance from
Colombo, it lay high up in the mountains, and
was most difficult of approach, the roads being
bad, the jungle dense, and the passes dangerous.
On the 31st January 1803, the 51st, forming part
of General Macdowall's column, commenced the
march, and after surmounting many difficulties,
on the 19th February stormed and carried two
strong posts, and put the enemy to flight. Hard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>ships
and sickness told considerably on the men,
but within a week of the first brush with the
enemy, the 19th and 51st Regiments marched into
Kandy, which the enemy had evacuated and set
on fire. The capture of the capital had been
tolerably simple, but little good came of it, for
the General soon found that sickness had reduced
his force to less than two thousand men, barely
one half of whom were Europeans, that supplies
were running short, and that his communications
with Colombo were cut by the enemy, who began
to assume a threatening attitude on all sides of
Kandy. A few skirmishes took place during
March; when, learning that no reinforcements
would be sent to him, Macdowall patched up a
truce with the Kandians, and leaving a thousand
men, two-thirds of whom were natives, to garrison
Kandy, withdrew the remainder of his force, including
the 51st, in safety to Colombo, which was
reached on the 9th April.</p>

<p>During the rest of the year small detachments
of the regiment were employed in repelling aggressions
on the part of the Kandians, who raided
British territory in many directions. Several
officers and a considerable number of men died
of disease, and the 51st was reduced to a mere
skeleton. Nor was the health of the other troops
at Colombo any better; and when it became known,
in June 1803, that the garrison at Kandy, now a
handful of weaklings, was being besieged by the
infuriated Kandians, it was found to be impossible
to send a force to its relief; and India could not
spare a single man for Ceylon, as all available<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
troops were required for the Mahratta War. In
the end, the Kandians recaptured their capital,
and murdered the remnant of the British garrison
in cold blood, though preserving the life of Major
Davie, the commandant, whom they cast into
prison, doubtless under the impression that he
might be useful to them some day. The war
died out in 1805, without any attempt on the
part of the British to revenge their murdered
compatriots, for the reason that no sufficient reinforcements
were ever available, and the fate of
Major Davie is pitiful to think of. For nearly
nine years he languished in a dungeon in Kandy,
and died there, worn out by disease, not to be
revenged until 1815, when the power of the
Kandian kings was broken for ever, and the
whole island taken over by the British.</p>

<p>The 51st continued to garrison Colombo until
1807, and suffered much from the enervating
climate, losing a great many officers and men,
and having a number of officers invalided home&mdash;amongst
them Samuel Rice, whose constitution
was undermined, and who never really recovered
from the effects of service in Ceylon, although
he managed to fight through many subsequent
campaigns. In September the remnant of the
regiment landed in England, after an absence
of fifteen years, the last nine of which had
been passed in absolute exile. Home news lost
most of its interest during the six or eight
months which it took to drift through to Ceylon,
and what was going on in Europe affected the
exiles little, for their own petty war and its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
attendant hardships gave them sufficient to think
about. Yet, in Europe stirring events had been
in progress, and the 51st, in going to the East,
were denied the satisfaction of taking part in the
reoccupation of the Mediterranean, which commenced
with the capture of Minorca by a force
under Sir Charles Stuart, only a month after the
regiment sailed from Lisbon. They missed also
the subsequent capture of Malta in 1800, and
the chance of sharing in Abercromby's great
victories over the French in Egypt in 1801. But
they did not miss much else, for the Peace of
Amiens (March 1802) brought the war to a close,
and though France again declared war against
England fourteen months later, no actual fighting
took place on shore. The British navy, however,
continued to be actively employed, more
especially in frustrating Napoleon's designs for
an invasion of England, and this grand scheme
was finally wrecked in October 1805, when the
mighty Nelson, at the cost of his life, almost
annihilated the French fleet at the Battle of
Trafalgar. Napoleon being thus deprived of the
means of transporting his "Army of England"
across the Channel, turned and vented his wrath
on Continental Europe, carried his conquests far
and wide, and proclaimed one of his brothers King
of Naples, and another King of Holland.</p>

<p>That there was plenty of fighting in prospect
for the army was apparent to the officers of the
51st when they reached England, but for the
moment they had no men, and the next few
months were devoted to bringing the regiment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
up to strength, as well as to gaining an insight
into the vast changes which had taken place in
the army and in military methods during the past
decade; for the officers, who had been absent from
England for so long, soon realised that they were
considerably behind the times. In Ceylon they
had heard little or nothing of the great reforms
in progress at home&mdash;reforms initiated by none
other than their old commanding officer, Major-General
John Moore, and, as will be shown in the
next chapter, far-reaching in their ultimate results.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">CHAPTER VI.</a><br />
<span class="center xs">THE REFORM OF THE ARMY.</span></h2>

<p class="noindent">After such brilliant work as was done by
Abercromby's army in Egypt in 1801, it may
seem strange that any one should have questioned
the ability of the British army to meet and defeat
any numerically equal force in Europe. Fortunately
for England, however, there were in the
army officers whose deep study of their profession
told them that the tactics of fighting were moving
towards a change, and that old methods before
long would have to pass away. Fortunately,
again, such officers were not carried away by the
glamour of the recent victories in Egypt, and the
fact that they themselves participated in those
victories added considerably to the weight of their
counsels. It has always been the case that campaigns,
however successful they may have been,
have been followed by reforms in the army; for it
is only from experience gained in actual warfare
that it is possible to discover the shortcomings of a
force, or how to set matters to rights. There was,
therefore, nothing peculiar in the move which
was made in 1802 towards overhauling the
affairs of the army, and the prime mover in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
the reforms was the Commander-in-Chief, H.R.H.
the Duke of York.</p>

<p>As was mentioned in an earlier chapter, it was
common knowledge, as far back as 1792, that a
long immunity from European warfare was beginning
to tell on the wellbeing of the British army,
and that the officers were in a measure losing
touch with their profession. Still, no immediate
action was taken, and the good work done in
India, the West Indies, and elsewhere led the
authorities to believe that there was nothing very
much amiss. In 1802, however, came the opportunity.
The peace patched up in that year
brought about extensive reductions in the establishment
of the British army, and it became
necessary to place a great many officers on half
pay. Moore, who, after much foreign service, was
then commanding the Canterbury district, and
who, as we have previously shown, had great
ideas on the subject of good officers, seized the
opportunity offered by these reductions to weed
out such officers as he deemed undesirable. The
matter of seniority was nothing to him, and he
applied, at any rate to the regiments under his
immediate command, the hitherto unheard-of
principle&mdash;selection, pure and simple, and made
by himself. His methods were somewhat severe,
and he did not confine his operations to the junior
officers, as is evident from his correspondence with
the Adjutant-General of the Army. "Some commanding
officers," he wrote in 1803, "the state of
whose regiments justify it, must be told to retire
from the service, the duties of which they are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
unequal to. The command must not be allowed
to devolve upon their majors, who may be equally
incapable, but be given to officers of approved
talents. One or two measures of this sort generally
known would excite an exertion which at
present is much wanted."<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>

<p>Moore was ably supported, not only by the
Commander-in-Chief, but also by his old commanding
officer of Corsican days, General David
Dundas, who, in these early years of reform, first
was Quartermaster-General of the Army, and
afterwards was in command of the Southern
District&mdash;and so again Moore's commanding
officer. Moore's suggestions carried immense
weight with the authorities, and a great number
of officers who had failed to take their profession
seriously found themselves retired on half pay.
The result, though disastrous to the officers concerned,
put new life into the commissioned ranks,
and opened the way for the remodelling of the
whole organisation of the army. The question of
the officers having been settled, and their zeal and
efficiency having been assured, Moore's work was
simplified, and it was on Moore&mdash;only a major-general
commanding a comparatively small district&mdash;that
the military authorities leaned in
carrying out their scheme for the reorganisation
of the army. This was, of course, natural enough,
for Moore himself, if not the originator of the
scheme, was at any rate the chosen mouthpiece of
General Dundas, whose views concerning the
training of troops were held in high esteem. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
what is not easy to understand is the absence of
opposition on the part of the older conservative
officers, senior to Moore. The fact, however,
remains that he was given a free hand, and when,
in 1803, he determined to reform the discipline
and training of the army on lines which he had
been working out for many years, principally
during active service in the West Indies, Holland,
and Egypt, he was given the command of a special
brigade of selected regiments, with which he was
permitted to experiment to his heart's content.</p>

<p>The sole purpose of his system was to convert
the British army into a thoroughly sound and
reliable fighting machine, suitable to the times.
He had observed that Napoleon was adopting new
tactics; he foresaw that the times were changing;
and he realised the fact that the experiences of
fighting in India, in the West Indies, in Holland,
and in Egypt would be of small value to troops
pitted against Napoleon's trained veterans in
Europe, unless such experiences were thoroughly
examined, with a view to discovering if the army
had learned anything worth learning, or if it was
still behind the times. Moore was perfectly convinced
that in tactical formations in the attack
and the defence the methods of the infantry of the
army were out of date; but he knew, also, that the
men of the British army were made of sound stuff,
and that under efficient officers they could be
trained to do anything. It is worthy of note,
however, that the changes which Moore introduced
did not arise, as is usually the case, from
any improvement in firearms, but rather from a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
careful study of recent campaigns in various parts
of the world. In short, Moore saw what was
wrong, and endeavoured to set matters right, with
what result will presently be shown.</p>

<p>In order to understand how it came about that
the British infantry within a few years proved
more than a match for the French in the Peninsular
War, it is necessary to have some knowledge
of the methods of fighting previously adopted by
the armies of the two nations, and then to see how
Moore altered these methods, by assimilating the
good and by eliminating the bad, by pruning and
by inducing fresh growth. We shall see that, in
the new system of training, everything depended
on the regimental officer; and we shall see that,
when war came, it was the regimental officer who
made the British army almost invincible.</p>

<p>Without entering too deeply into the history of
tactics, we may say that up to the middle of the
eighteenth century the fighting formation of infantry,
whether in attack or defence, consisted
generally of solid bodies of troops, which marched
up in two massive columns, and then deployed, in
the face of the opposing force, into two lines each
composed of three ranks. Skirmishers were then
unknown; and very great attention was paid to
drill. About 1757 we find the Austrians using
light troops (Croats) to harass Frederick the
Great's army on the march; but these do not
appear to have been properly organised, and,
though always annoying, they seldom acted with
real judgment. In 1774 Mesnil Durand invented
a system in which skirmishers played a consider<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>able
part. Battalions were to move in double
company columns at deploying intervals, two of
the ten companies of each battalion acting as
skirmishers to cover the whole front of the line of
columns. It was held that in this way the fire of
the skirmishers would make itself felt to such an
extent that it would only remain for the heavy
columns behind to push in and crush the enemy by
sheer weight. This was to a certain extent the
system adopted by the French in 1793, and
employed by the French generals in the Peninsular
War, and by Napoleon until his final defeat
at Waterloo, except that the columns of attack
were deep and solid, and not merely single battalion
columns or lines of battalion columns.</p>

<p>It may therefore be said that skirmishers first
took their place in the organisation of Continental
armies about 1774, but years before that the question
of their employment had been freely discussed.
As early as 1754 Comte Lancelot Turpin
de Crissé had published a work on the Art of
War, in which he dealt with the uses of light
troops at some length, and the British army had
had its bodies of trained light infantrymen certainly
before 1758.<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> In all probability they
originated about the year 1757, when the British
generals, fighting against the French in America,
found that the latter's Red Indian allies perpetually
annoyed them on the march and on
other occasions, and determined to meet them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
in their own methods of fighting. Consequently,
every regiment in America was ordered to select
"the most enterprising officers and the most
active of the privates with the appellation of
<em>Rangers</em>." Lord Howe, then commanding the
55th Regiment, but in 1758 raised to the command
of the army in the field, was immensely
impressed by the Red Indian methods of warfare,
and was supported by several commanding officers,
who realised the absurdities of tight clothes and
movements in solid formation, when engaging the
enemy in the rough forest country of the New
World. The success which attended the experiment
of the <em>Rangers</em> led to the formation of a
light company in every regiment, and the valuable
services which these companies performed
during the next few years fully justified their
existence. And the matter was carried still
further, for, in 1758, a whole regiment was
equipped for light work, and named Gage's
Light Infantry.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> In that year, however, while
leading a desperate attack on the French, Howe
was shot dead, at the head of the <em>Rangers</em>, in the
hour of victory.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>
<p>At the peace of 1763 all the light companies
of regiments were reduced, and the lessons learned
in America for the time being were forgotten. In
1770, however, some one remembered the value
of light troops, and the light companies were
established afresh. In all probability that some
one was Lord Howe's brother, General William
Howe, who had distinguished himself as a leader
of light infantry in Wolfe's Quebec campaign of
1759, for in 1774 he was allowed to take the light
companies of seven regiments to Salisbury, and
exercise them as a battalion in certain manœuvres
which he had invented. There was apparently
little similarity between Howe's formations and
those of Mesnil Durand mentioned above, for
whereas the latter's flank companies were employed
with their own battalion, as part and
parcel of it in the fight, Howe's idea was to take
these companies away from their regiments, and
form them into separate battalions, for distinct
and special work. In this way Sir William Howe,
in chief command of the British forces, employed
the flank companies of regiments during the War
of American Independence, the most important
and most hazardous duties being performed by
battalions composed of them.</p>

<p>Both Viscount Howe and his brother, Sir
William, gained their first knowledge of light
troops from the Red Indians, and it may perhaps
be remarked that, in 1880-1881, irregular warfare
with the Boers gave us the idea of mounted
infantry. There is a striking analogy between
the old light infantry and the modern mounted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
infantry: each was the outcome of a desire for
greater mobility than ordinary infantry soldiers
were capable of; each began in the same way;
the light company and the mounted infantry company
contained the picked men of the battalion,
and, in war, these companies of the best men were
taken away from their regiments to work, with
similar companies of other regiments, as separate
battalions, the merits or demerits of which it is
not necessary to enter into here.</p>

<p>To return to the development of light troops
in the British army. In 1782 the light companies
of nine regiments were assembled in camp at Coxheath,
Kent, and, together with two battalions
of infantry and two regiments of light dragoons,
were practised in what was termed the "Dundas
Exercises," which were being tried for the first
time. A year or two later, Dundas visited the
Prussian manœuvres, obtained some fresh ideas,
and then published his monumental work, which
eventually became the first drill-book authorised
to be used in the British army. Dundas, however,
had very little new to say about light troops,
and his exercises were practically on the Continental
model. In 1794 Sir Thomas Graham<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>
(afterwards Lord Lynedoch) raised a regiment
(which was numbered the 90th), and had it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
equipped and drilled as a light infantry corps,
though it was not recognised officially as such
for another eleven years. It was in the above
year that Moore was working with Corsican troops
in the field, and he always considered the Corsicans
the best light infantrymen in the world,
although he acknowledged that they lacked the
discipline necessary for holding their own against
highly-trained troops. In 1798 Howe<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> again came
to the front, and superintended the training of a
brigade of all arms, assembled on the Essex coast,
in his light drill. Lastly, in 1800, H.R.H. the
Commander-in-Chief ordered the assembly at
Horsham of a temporary corps, for the purpose
of training a body of men in the use of the rifle,
fourteen regiments being called upon to furnish
thirty privates and a proportion of officers and
non-commissioned officers. After the summer
training, these men were moved to Blatchington,
and were then formed into the Rifle Corps (95th),<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>
for whom Colonel Coote Manningham and Lieutenant-Colonel
the Hon. W. Stewart drew up the
famous 'Regulations for the Rifle Corps,' published
in 1801. The methods of training these riflemen
were very similar to those employed in training
temporary light infantry corps composed of the
light companies of regiments, except in so far as
the superior range and accuracy of the rifle over
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>the flintlock musket altered the conditions of the
attack and defence.</p>

<p>By this time it had been discovered that Napoleon
had developed the use of his <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">voltigeurs</i> enormously,
and that his victories were being secured
by the judicious employment of these light troops;
so English books dealing with the systematic
training of light troops now began to appear.
The earliest of these was one based on a translation
of a work by a "German officer of distinction
and of much military experience," which, first
produced in 1798 (reprinted in 1801 and 1803),
under the title of 'Regulations for the Exercise
of Riflemen and Light Infantry, and Instructions
for their Conduct in the Field,' was ordered to
be studied by all officers of the army. Who that
German officer was is never made clear, and in
1803 there appeared another and a far more valuable
work, entitled 'A Treatise upon the Duties
of Light Troops,' translated from the German of
Colonel Von Ehwald, but there is nothing in this
book to lead one to believe that Von Ehwald was
the author of the earlier work. The gallant Colonel
had served in the Seven Years' War, commanded
a corps of Hessian jägers, in British pay, during
the American War of Independence, and subsequently
commanded a light corps of the Danish
army, and his book contains a mass of useful information
on the training of light troops, as well
as examples of their work in the field during
several campaigns.</p>

<p>Judging by the contents of this treatise, it is
more than probable that Sir John Moore had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
studied it in the original, for Von Ehwald's ideas
on discipline and training were identical with
those upon which Moore subsequently set to work.
Both Von Ehwald and Moore held the opinion
that an army which could place in the field large
numbers of light troops, so highly trained and
disciplined as to be capable of working intelligently
in extended order in more or less independent
small parties, would be able to outflank,
outmanœuvre, and defeat an enemy of superior
strength who adhered to close formations. Rapidity
of movement, however, and the ability to
make good use of ground as well as of their firearms,
were essential to the success of light troops,
and Moore knew that unless there could be produced
a higher standard of discipline than was
yet known in the British army, it would be impossible
to create light troops of any value. And
Moore's ideas of discipline differed somewhat from
those of most officers of the time, in that he did
not believe in the "mechanical discipline" which
made a mere automaton of the soldier, but rather
in that "intelligent discipline, best illustrated,
perhaps, by a pack of well-trained hounds, running
in no order, but, without a straggler, each
making good use of his instinct, and following the
same object with the same relentless perseverance."<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>
In his determination to establish this
new form of discipline lay Moore's success, and
he always maintained that by no other means
than by inculcating the strictest habits of intelligent
discipline in all ranks could self-reliance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
and initiative come natural to a body of troops.
Whether he discovered this for himself, or whether
he learned it from Von Ehwald, or whether, again,
both of them were following the lead of Napoleon,
whose skirmishers had already made their mark
in European warfare, the fact remains that Sir
John Moore was the first person to attempt to
apply it to a large number of British soldiers,
and he was the first person to succeed.</p>

<p>In the summer of 1803, therefore, Moore commenced
work with his famous brigade at Shorncliffe
Camp, and he decided to train his brigade
as light troops, not in the usual way by extemporising
battalions out of light companies detached
from various regiments, but by employing whole
regiments. For this purpose the 52nd and the
43rd were, in 1803, formed into light infantry
regiments, and, together with the newly raised
Rifle Corps (95th), handed over to Moore to train.
He began at the beginning, and thoroughly overhauled
the existing regimental systems; he went
deeply into interior economy, and instituted many
reforms&mdash;so far-reaching and excellent that they
have remained almost unaltered to the present
day. He insisted that discipline could only be
maintained by the officers of all ranks always
being in touch with their men, and ever having
their welfare at heart. A hard worker himself,
he saw that all the officers of his brigade worked
hard also; and during the training seasons at
Shorncliffe the officers were seldom off duty on
week-days, and had to brush up for the General's
inspection on Sundays, for Moore did not recog<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>nise
any necessity for recreation. On one occasion
the father of a young officer wrote to the General
to say that he proposed to send his son a horse.
Moore's reply was characteristic: "that he should
be very pleased that the horse should be sent,
but that it would be necessary for the father to
send with it some one to ride it, for his son would
have no time to do so."<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> His first care was to
have efficient officers; he watched them carefully,
and he got rid of those whom he deemed useless
for his purpose, thus laying the foundation-stone
of the future building. With good and reliable
officers, establishing a chain of responsibility from
highest to lowest, with a thorough organisation
of battalions on the company system, with non-commissioned
officers and men no longer ruled
with a rod of iron, but respecting and relying
on their officers, Moore began to see his way
clear.</p>

<p>His next step was to practise, for a considerable
time, drill and movements in close formation&mdash;a
proof that he was thorough, as well as patient.
An ordinary man with a new hobby to ride might
have been inclined to slur over, if not scoff at,
things which he considered old-fashioned. But
Moore had a use for them, because he intended
to make his brigade absolutely perfect, and an
example to be followed by every other brigade
in the British army. His brigade was to be
steadier on parade and better drilled than any
other, and until he was sure that it was so, he
restrained himself from taking the regiments on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
to their training as light troops. And he had
other reasons, for he felt that square drill, practised
as a means to an end, was the best discipline
for men who were presently to act independently
and work out things for themselves. Moreover,
he knew that light troops alone would not win
a battle, but that they must be supported by
well-disciplined bodies of men, moving in close
formation and maintaining strict order, until the
moment arrived for them to be thrown into the
fight.</p>

<p>Sir David Dundas took the greatest interest
in all that Moore was doing, and often visited
his camp. His drill-book was still the official
manual, and, as the first of its kind, was of the
greatest value. "There was, however, so much
that was rigid, formal, and unnecessary in
Dundas's drill that it gained for him the nickname
of 'Old Pivot'; while he also made the
fatal mistake of distributing the whole science
of military evolution into eighteen manœuvres,
which were a sad stumbling-block to slow-witted
officers. 'General,' said Sir John Moore to him
in 1804, 'that book of yours has done a great
deal of good, and would be of great value if it
were not for those damned eighteen manœuvres.'
'Why&mdash;ay,' answered Dundas slowly in broad
Scots, 'blockheads don't understand.'"<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> Yet
Moore struggled manfully with the eighteen
manœuvres, and tried new methods of performing
them, before passing on to lighter movements&mdash;extended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
order formations, advanced-guards,
rear-guards, and outposts.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly, Moore's opportunity was unique,
for his brigade had its place in the defence of
England, and it was thought that the French
intended to land somewhere near Shorncliffe.
Consequently, the brigade was considered to be
on active service, and at the same time was being
trained for war, a state of affairs which naturally
tended to make all ranks keen to acquire military
knowledge. There was none of the make-believe
of peace training; only a few miles of sea lay
between the brigade and the enemy, and on any
dark night the French might attempt to effect
a landing between the Martello Towers which
studded the coast-line. At night, therefore, these
towers and three neighbouring forts were fully
manned, and outposts covered the camp on the
heights above, the sentries being provided with
ball ammunition. By day, while a look-out was
still maintained by the guards, the brigade was
drilled and practised at manœuvring over the
country inland; and now and again the order
was given to strike camp and march, when,
within an hour, the whole brigade loaded up
and moved off&mdash;with everything complete and
ready for active service in any quarter of the
globe. All this resulted from the discipline
which the General instilled into his regiments,
and for three continuous years he had them in
his care. So that when, in 1806, he was called
away for service in Sicily, he left his brigade in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
the highest state of discipline, and as light troops
certainly superior to any in Europe. The proof
of this Moore did not live to see, but his three
regiments a few years later formed the Light
Division, which throughout the Peninsular War
carried all before it.</p>

<p>Moore developed light movements enormously,
producing a marvellous elasticity in comparatively
large bodies of troops, and under his training
whole regiments became as mobile and rapid in
manœuvre as previously no company of a regiment
had been. To swiftly reach a given point,
and there bring as many rifles or muskets as
possible into the firing line; to make every officer
and man use his own intelligence in carrying out
movements; and to impress upon them the necessity
for mutual support,&mdash;were the chief aims of
Moore's training; and he it was who originated
for the British army that self-dependent Thin
Red Line which so soon was to become the destroyer
of Napoleon's deep and massive columns.
For it was proved over and over again in the
long war which followed, that, with opposing
forces of equal numbers, the line two-deep, every
man of which was so disciplined as to stand firm,
and every man of which had the opportunity of
using his rifle or musket, could make short work
of the more condensed three-deep line, or of the
column which presented a large target, and which
at the same time could return the fire only from
the muskets of two ranks at the contracted head
of the column. It is interesting to note that
Colonel Von Ehwald was a strong advocate of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
the two-deep line both in attack and in defence,
for purposes of firing as well as for using the
bayonet. "In an attack with charged bayonets,"
he says, "I am convinced that, if the corps drawn
up in two ranks advances resolutely upon the
other in three, it will not be worse off for that
rank less, as the pressure of one upon the other,
of which the French tacticians speak, exists only
in the imagination."</p>

<p>Now, the outcome of all this training of light
troops was a new fighting formation for the
British army. In the first place, Moore had
proved that whole regiments could become intelligent
and reliable skirmishers, if properly
taught; and he had proved, also, that companies,
or smaller bodies, of skirmishers, acting independently
though at the same time working towards
the consummation of a "general idea," were of
the highest value when the commanders of skirmishing
units were allowed a free hand. Next,
Moore had discovered that, with these highly
trained bodies of skirmishers out in front, harassing
the enemy in every direction, keeping down
his fire, and shattering his <em>moral</em>, massive bodies
of troops in rear were no longer required. So
he instituted the attack formation as follows:&mdash;First,
the skirmishers in some strength; second,
a two-deep line in close order; third, a similar
line; and it was with these two lines, always
kept in hand, that the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup-de-grâce</i>&mdash;in the
shape of a withering volley, followed by a bayonet
charge&mdash;was given, at the moment when the
enemy had begun to feel the effects of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
bickerings of the skirmishers. But the secret
of success in the employment of these shadowy
lines against the enemy's columns lay not only
in the efficiency of the skirmishers, but also in
the superior discipline of the troops behind, who
were brought up in line of quarter-columns to
within effective range of the position, and then
deployed into shoulder to shoulder lines of two
ranks. It was for these reasons that Moore
drilled his regiments to become equally proficient
in close order movements as in skirmishing.
Simple as all this may appear nowadays,
it was a revolution in fighting methods, and
necessitated a vast amount of preliminary training
and disciplining; but Moore's system had
been carefully watched by the authorities, and
so satisfied were they of its soundness, that it
was applied as far as possible to all regiments
of the army. It took time, but the ultimate
result was good, and it was soon found that a
new spirit was gradually passing into all ranks.</p>

<p>To sum up the nature of the reforms introduced
into the army between 1802 and 1807: we find,
to begin with, a marked improvement in the zeal
and efficiency of the officers, produced not only
by getting rid of the useless ones, but also by
the introduction of new regulations relating to
the grant of first commissions and subsequent
promotion. Thus the minimum age for an ensign
was fixed at sixteen,<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> and an officer was required
to have served at least three years for promotion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
to the rank of captain, and seven years to that
of major. Next we find the establishment of a
new and high code of discipline, as well as of
morals, among both officers and men, from which
followed a closer union between the one and the
other, and a greater regard for the welfare of
the soldier on the part of the officer. Again,
one uniform system of drill and manœuvre was
laid down and rigidly enforced for each arm of
the service, for hitherto such matters had been
left to the commanding officers of corps. "Such
changes," wrote Lord Londonderry,<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> "together
with the establishment of hospitals for the
wounded and disabled soldiers, and for the education
of children whose parents had fallen in
the defence of their country, could not fail of
producing the most beneficial effect upon the
<em>moral</em> of the British army, which, from being
an object of something like abhorrence to its
own countrymen, and of contempt to the troops
of other nations, rose to command, as well as to
deserve, the esteem of the former, and the respect
and admiration of the latter."</p>

<p>The above is an outline of <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'the somewat'">the somewhat</ins> startling
ideas connected with military reform which
were thrust upon the officers of the 51st on arriving
home from Ceylon in the autumn of 1807, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
they were not slow to appreciate the situation.
Their men were all new to them, as they had
brought few back to England, and they realised
at once that it would require strenuous efforts
on their part to make up the leeway. It speaks
well for them that they were not found wanting,
and they were fortunate in having a commanding
officer<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> capable of rising to the occasion. The
necessity of getting into fighting trim with all
speed was apparent to every one; for the cloud
over Europe still hung low and black, and the
British expedition sent to Copenhagen was at
the moment destroying the Danish fleet&mdash;an act
which, it was well known, would increase Napoleon's
hatred of England tenfold. And so it
proved, for before the end of the year a French
army invaded Portugal and entered Lisbon, and
Napoleon thus fulfilled his promise of humbling
England's ancient ally.</p>

<p>The difficulties encountered by the regiment in
learning its new work were increased by constant
changes of station; first it was quartered
at Chatham, then at Chichester, while early in
1808 it moved to Gosport, and in the spring to
Guernsey. There is no doubt that the regimental
officers had plenty to do, with parades
morning and evening, and with a considerable
amount of routine work connected with interior
economy. They were up early, as a subaltern
of each company had to call the company roll
and inspect the rooms immediately after reveille,
and they were kept busy until they had seen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
the men have their dinners at 1 <span class="xs">P.M.</span> At three
o'clock the officers dined, and turned out for
parade afterwards; so they had very little leisure
for recreation, though what form of recreation
officers and men indulged in at this period is
never made very clear. Some of the officers
hunted and shot, but outdoor games, as we know
them now, had not come into fashion. Cricket
and football were in their infancy, and had not
reached the army; nor were there any organised
athletic sports; and, in all probability, the only
games played by the men were skittles, and a
kind of "fives" in what was termed the "ball
alley." Only by marching were the soldiers kept
in good condition, for it had not yet been discovered
that there was a value in wholesome
recreation.</p>

<p>By the spring of 1808 the 51st was a regiment
again, but in the matter of dress quite a different
regiment to that which left Lisbon for India ten
years before; for the uniform of the army had
undergone alterations, and the mode of dressing
the hair had changed. The "queue," which had
taken the place of the "club" in 1799, and which
was at first ten inches in length, was now shortened
to seven inches, and was tied, a little below
the upper part of the collar of the coat, with a
black bow,<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> so that one inch of hair remained
free at the end; the men's coiffure, however, being
no longer powdered white. The officers still wore
powdered hair and cocked hats of considerable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
size, sometimes putting them on even with the
shoulders, at other times fore and aft; but for
the men a new head-dress had been devised, and
this took the form of a cylindrical shako, with a
brass plate in front and above it a red and white
tuft coming out of a black cockade. The red coat
had changed its shape, and was buttoned up tight
to the waist, the lapels, in the case of the officers'
coats, reaching right down, and being so made
that they could be buttoned across to form a
double-breasted coat, or thrown back to show the
lining of facing cloth&mdash;something after the fashion
of the front of the present lancer tunic. The
officers also wore very high and roomy collars,
to admit the large black neckcloth, which was
now much affected. And thus turned out, the
whole regiment was undoubtedly as smart as
could be,&mdash;but what was better, the officers and
men were efficient soldiers.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile, events on the Continent had
gone from bad to worse, and Napoleon, not content
with the occupation of Portugal, had thrown
off his alliance with Spain, marched on Madrid,
and transferred his brother Joseph from the throne
of Naples to that of Spain. England at once rose
to the occasion, decided to free Portugal and Spain
from the French yoke, and forthwith launched an
expedition of about 25,000 men for the purpose.
The 51st, having so recently returned from foreign
service, was not included in the expeditionary
force, which landed, on the 1st August (1808),
on the Portuguese coast, near the mouth of the
Mondego river, and commenced the advance on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
Lisbon. On the 16th the French were first encountered
at Obidos, where a slight skirmish took
place, and on the following day Sir Arthur Wellesley
fought and won the battle of Roliça.<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> Without
entering into the details of this the first campaign
of the Peninsular War, we may mention that the
British and Portuguese routed the French at
Vimiera on the 21st August, and before the end
of the month the enemy, by the Convention of
Cintra, agreed to evacuate Portugal. After this
the British army occupied Lisbon, and prepared
for operations against the French in Spain.</p>

<p>While these events were in progress, the
51st, chafing at having been left behind, were
moved from Guernsey to Chichester, and before
long had the satisfaction of receiving their orders
for active service.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">CHAPTER VII.</a><br />
<span class="center xs">THE CORUNNA CAMPAIGN, AND AFTER.</span></h2>

<p class="noindent">After the occupation of Lisbon, Sir Arthur
Wellesley, deeming it improbable that the army
would resume operations for some months, went
home on leave of absence; and, a little later, Sir
John Moore was given command of the British
forces in Portugal. In October he received despatches
from Government wherein he was informed
that it had been decided to send Sir David Baird,
with 10,000 men, to Corunna, and Moore was
instructed to take the 20,000 British troops from
Lisbon, and to form a junction with him forthwith,
when, together with the Spanish army, he was to
attack the French and drive them out of Spain.</p>

<p>To carry out his orders Moore had a choice of
routes; he could transport his force by sea to
Corunna, or he could march through Portugal
and Spain. The former plan he rejected, as being
likely to cause delay; for, with sailing vessels and
at such a season of the year, it was impossible to
estimate the length of time that the voyage would
occupy. He decided, therefore, to adopt the land
route, knowing that, if necessary, he could send
his ships up the coast to some port, which would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
then become his base, instead of Lisbon. Accordingly,
he desired Baird to march south-east to
meet him at a point to be afterwards named,
probably either Valladolid or Burgos, but the
exact spot depending on the movements of the
French.</p>

<p>Nearly three months before this the 51st had
been warned for active service, and on the 18th
August marched from Chichester to Portsmouth,
where the regiment embarked in three transports,
to join Sir David Baird's force, then assembling at
Falmouth for some undisclosed destination. The
regiment, mustering six hundred bayonets, was in
fine fettle, and Captain Sam Rice was in command
of the light infantry company. But eager
as he and his brother officers were to get to
business, they were forced to possess their souls
in patience, for they were kept on board their
transports for upwards of two months, with little
or nothing to do, except to discuss the object of
the expedition, their knowledge of which was
vague in the extreme. As far as the soldiers
were concerned, they were jubilant, and from a
cause which nowadays may seem trivial. The
order had gone forth that their hair was no longer
to be "tied," but cut short at the neck! At
length the long weeks of waiting came to an end,
and on the 8th October Baird's fleet of transports
sailed from Falmouth, five days later anchoring off
Corunna. But even then further delays occurred,
as the Spanish officials objected to the landing of
the force, and it was another fortnight before the
disembarkation was completed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>To return to Moore. Before the end of October
he had set his troops in motion, but his arrangements
were much upset by the reports of the
state of the roads which he wished to utilise for
his march. So bad were they said to be, that
he considered it advisable to divide his force and
move by two routes; and before long he had
reason to be anxious about the safety of his
detached columns, for the situation was undergoing
a change. At the time of his departure
from Lisbon, Moore had every reason to believe
that the Spanish troops, aided by the British
forces under himself and Baird, would be able to
deal a heavy blow to the French invaders, and
in this belief he was supported by the knowledge
that King Joseph, fearful of the impending attack,
had withdrawn from Madrid to the neighbourhood
of Vittoria, where he concentrated the French
army on the Ebro. But Moore did know that at
this very time Napoleon was pouring reinforcements
over the Pyrenees in such quantities as to
bring the strength of the French in Spain up to
some 250,000 men.</p>

<p>Napoleon had determined to secure Spain and
Portugal at all costs; and, placing himself at the
head of the reinforcements, early in November
defeated a Spanish force which attempted to bar
his way, and advanced rapidly to Burgos. Thence
he pushed a corps to the Carrion river, to protect
his right flank from the British, while he moved
on Madrid. In the meantime, Moore's main body
was marching, viâ Ciudad Rodrigo, on Salamanca;
while Hope, with the cavalry, artillery, and am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>munition,
had been sent by the circuitous route,
Badajoz, Talavera, Madrid, Escorial Pass, to rejoin
Moore at Salamanca, Valladolid, Burgos, or elsewhere,
according to orders to be issued to him
later.</p>

<p>On the 15th November Moore reached Salamanca,
and learned that the French had already
occupied Valladolid. Consequently he decided to
wait at Salamanca until Baird and Hope could
join him. But the two latter had met with great
difficulties in the matter of transport, and had
been delayed beyond all expectations, so that on
the 26th November the head of Baird's column
had got no farther than Astorga, five marches
north-west of Salamanca, and Hope was at the
Escorial Pass, six marches south-east of Salamanca.
On that same day Lefebre's French Corps,
of 30,000 men, was approaching Valladolid, barely
three marches north-east of Salamanca, while
Napoleon himself, marching on Madrid, was at
Arauda, some sixty miles as the crow flies due
east of Valladolid. Fortunately for the divided
British forces, Napoleon was in ignorance of their
whereabouts; neither, on the other hand, was
Moore aware of the exact situation of the French,
until two days later, when both he and Hope
were informed of Napoleon's proximity.</p>

<p>Hope realised at once that he must risk everything
in the attempt to take his artillery and
ammunition to Moore at Salamanca; while the
latter, after sending orders to Baird to retire on
Corunna or Vigo, decided to wait as long as
possible for Hope, and then, retracing his steps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
into Portugal, defend the frontier and cover
Lisbon. Fortune favoured Hope, who, making a
desperate cross-country march, successfully formed
a junction with Moore at Salamanca, whereupon
Moore changed his plans. He had heard that the
Spaniards intended to defend Madrid to the last,
and, in order to assist them in their endeavour,
he determined on a bold stroke. He saw that
Napoleon's vast army was, like some beast of
prey, sprawled out over the provinces of Spain and
crawling forward with open jaws within measurable
distance of Madrid; he saw the hopelessness
of trying conclusions with a beast ten times his
own strength, but he knew that if he suddenly
dealt a furious blow on the beast's tail the beast
would spring round and attempt to rend him.
This, then, was Sir John Moore's idea when, at the
beginning of December, he made up his mind to
strike at Napoleon's line of communications, which
stretched back to the Pyrenees. He calculated
that Napoleon would immediately turn upon him
with all his strength, and the Spanish and
Portuguese forces would thus be given time to
collect for the defence of their respective capitals.
His own subsequent line of action he had also
worked out carefully: having dealt his blow, and
having succeeded in bringing the bulk of the
French army against him, he would draw off his
little force to Corunna or Vigo, and at one or the
other place embark and sail to Lisbon or Cadiz.</p>

<p>Fresh orders were therefore despatched to
Baird, who had meanwhile retired from Astorga,
three marches to Villafranca. In these he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
instructed to advance towards Valladolid, and on
the 11th December Moore moved towards the
same place, reaching the river Douro on the 13th.
Here a French despatch was intercepted, and from
it Moore discovered the true state of affairs.
Napoleon had captured Madrid nine days before,
had despatched Lefebre towards Lisbon and his
other corps in various directions, and now ordered
Soult to move his corps from the Carrion river
westward into Galicia. It was also evident, from
this French despatch, that Napoleon had no knowledge
of the movements of the British, and that
Soult's corps was without support and of no great
strength. So Moore decided to strike at Soult
forthwith, and, with this object, arranged with
Baird to join forces at Mayorga, instead of at
Valladolid, at the same time instructing his ships
at Lisbon to proceed up the coast to Vigo, and
giving orders for the establishment of supply
depôts along the route by which he intended
eventually to withdraw to the ships.</p>

<p>Upon receipt of these orders Baird advanced
again to Astorga and, on the 20th December,
joined Moore at Mayorga. He took with him all
available battalions, but some were still in rear,
since the Spanish authorities had been unable to
provide transport or provisions on the road for
any but small bodies of troops moving at intervals
of some days. The 51st Regiment, forming part
of Leith's Brigade, was still far behind, and did
not come into the zone of operations until the
eventual retreat was in full swing. Moore, however,
now had sufficient men for his purpose, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
he knew that Soult's force was in numbers inferior
to his own; and the operations at once commenced
by a brilliant cavalry action, in which Paget, with
400 British sabres, routed 600 of the French
cavalry at Sahagun. Soult was now known to be
at Saldanha and Carrion, and Moore decided to
halt his force for forty-eight hours in order to
allow the rear divisions to close up, and then to
attack at dawn on the 24th December. On the
night of the 23rd-24th the troops set out on the
march which was to bring them at daylight before
the bridge of Carrion, but they had not marched
far before they received the unwelcome order to
retrace their steps and return to their bivouacs at
Sahagun. Moore had received information which
upset all his calculations; the scheme which he
had devised for drawing Napoleon's armies after
him had worked only too successfully, for he
learned that Napoleon was already in full march
upon him, and that within a few hours the situation
of the British army might become critical.
He determined, therefore, to abandon the attack
on Soult and endeavour to carry out his original
programme by withdrawing to his ships before
Napoleon's masses should fall upon him. That
Christmas day was spent by the disappointed
army in making the second march of the long
and arduous retreat to Corunna.</p>

<p>Napoleon, as was his wont when once his mind
was made up, came like a thunderbolt. On the
21st December, at the head of 40,000 men and
150 guns, he left Madrid, and, although he had to
negotiate high mountain passes, often blocked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
with snow, he marched a hundred miles in less
than five days, reaching Tordesillas, on the Douro,
on the 25th December, and having his advanced
cavalry well ahead of him on the way to Benevente.
He firmly believed that he and Soult had now
ringed-in Moore's force, which he imagined to be
still at Sahagun. But Moore, leaving only his
cavalry and the two light brigades of infantry at
that place, had slipped away in the nick of time
and had crossed the Esla by the 26th without
serious molestation. On the following day the
British cavalry fought long and gallantly and
completely checked the pursuit; on the 28th
Craufurd's light, or flank, brigade covered the
withdrawal of the cavalry over the Esla by the
bridge of Castro Gonzalo and then blew up the
bridge; and on the 29th the cavalry again covered
themselves with glory by defeating a strong body
of French horsemen who had succeeded in fording
the river.</p>

<p>On that day Moore's columns, which had been
marching by two different routes, re-united at
Astorga, and there the soldiers felt convinced that
they would be called upon to halt and fight, since
they knew that Moore had told the Spanish
general that he would make a stand at Astorga,
and they saw 10,000 Spaniards come into the
place. But Moore had given up all idea of
offering battle until he had reached the coast and
was within sight of his ships. His men had already
suffered from the hard marching in pouring
rain and in snow, and along bad roads ankle-deep
in mud; provisions were becoming scanty, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
General considered it advisable to push on with all
speed to Villafranca and Lugo, where large supply
depôts had been formed. On the 30th December
he rested his troops at Astorga, and by the 31st
both British and Spaniards were clear of the place,
which was entered within thirty-six hours by the
infantry of Napoleon and Soult, coming from La
Baneza, where they had joined hands in the
closing hours of 1808.</p>

<p>The new year opened on 25,000 dispirited, and
even sullen, British soldiers marching through the
snow-laden passes, and unable to understand why
they should not turn and fight. Discipline became
lax; the men broke the ranks in search of plunder
and drink; and the stragglers were only kept on
the move by the exertions of the cavalry of the
rearguard.</p>

<p>Yet Moore had outwitted Napoleon, who, in
sheer disgust at having failed to cut off his
adversary, halted two days at Benevente, handed
over the pursuit to Soult, and himself returned to
Paris&mdash;not again to encounter British troops in
the field until the eventful day when his fate was
sealed at Waterloo. His deputy, however, took
up the work with zeal and alacrity, and pressed
forward to Astorga as rapidly as possible.</p>

<p>The horrors of the retreat of the British army
after leaving Astorga have been so often described
that it is needless to refer to them further than to
say that, with the exception of some dozen
regiments, the troops were completely demoralised
and out of hand. Moore's feelings of bitterness
can be well understood, for here, almost at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
first trial, the discipline which he had assiduously
preached throughout his service had completely
broken down. But this condition of affairs existed
only among the troops of the main body, for the
regiments forming the rearguard (which included
the three which he had personally trained at
Shorncliffe) behaved throughout with conspicuous
gallantry and prevented Soult's pursuing force
from overwhelming the disorganised army.</p>

<p>Passing through Bembibre and Villafranca,
Moore reached Lugo after forced marching from
which the men were worn out, and here he decided
to halt in order to enable the stragglers to come
up, and, if necessary, give battle. This, in a
measure, raised the spirits of the army, as the men
far preferred the prospects of a fierce fight to those
of an immediate continuance of retreat. But,
perhaps, the greatest check to the demoralisation
which had set in was the fact that, at Lugo,
Moore had the satisfaction of finding a most
welcome addition to his force in Leith's Brigade
of 1800 fresh men, who had not been harassed
by the arduous marches of the past week, and
with Leith's Brigade, as has been already
mentioned, was the 51st Regiment and Captain
Sam Rice.</p>

<p>At Lugo, therefore, on the 6th January 1809,
Moore took up a strong position, and all ranks,
full of hopes of being speedily attacked, fell into
their places with evident delight. That same
evening the rearguard came into Lugo, and on the
following morning Soult appeared. But he felt
his way with caution, and soon learned that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
force opposed to him was not merely the rearguard,
which had always been keeping him back, but
Moore's whole army. Making a feint attack on
the Guards' Brigade on the right of the position,
he moved a division against the left, which was
held by Leith's Brigade. The fight soon began in
earnest; Soult's guns opened on the advanced
piquets of the 76th Regiment, which then fell
back on the 51st, when the two regiments began
to use their muskets with vigour. At this
moment Moore himself was an eye-witness of what
was taking place, and realising that Leith's men
were greatly outnumbered by their assailants, yet
knowing that he could spare no troops to reinforce
them, galloped up to the 51st, and, appealing to
his old regiment to stand firm, placed himself at
their head. The response was immediate and
unanimous. With a wild cheer the men emptied
their muskets at the enemy, then, without hesitation,
charged home, and drove the French before
them at the point of the bayonet. The day was
saved, and the enemy, with a loss of some three
hundred men, drew off.</p>

<p>But this gallant action, which received the well-merited
praise of the General, produced a state of
affairs such as Moore least desired; for Soult
feared to attack the position again until he should
receive reinforcements from the rear. Throughout
the 8th January the British army remained in its
position, expectant and ready, with its officers and
soldiers prepared to stake everything on the issue
of the hoped-for battle. Yet the day passed
without a sign of a French advance, and towards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
evening Moore's spirits fell, for he guessed that
Soult was waiting for reinforcements. At first he
thought of turning on his adversary while he was
still weak, but he came to the conclusion that the
risk was too great; on the other hand, to remain
where he was until Soult should consider himself
strong enough to renew the attack would be
suicidal. Therefore, he saw but one way open to
him&mdash;viz., to slip away from the position and
continue the retreat to the coast; and, his mind
made up, he issued his orders for the march.
Destroying such stores and horses as would hinder
their progress, and leaving their bivouac fires
burning in order to deceive the enemy, the disheartened
troops evacuated the position in the
dead of night. Fortune was against them all
through the night; rain fell in torrents, and the
inky darkness made it impossible for them to see
their way, so that, by dawn, instead of having put
fifteen miles between themselves and the enemy,
many benighted battalions, after marching all
night, found themselves but five miles from their
starting-point, and yet thoroughly exhausted.
But Soult did not discover that his enemy had
gone until late next morning, and even then he
appears to have been unwilling to push the
pursuit as rapidly as he might have done.</p>

<p>Continuing the retreat in wretched weather,
Moore's troops suffered every manner of hardship
and privation, but on reaching Betanzos, on the
morning of the 10th January, matters began to
improve. The columns were still well covered by
the rearguard, who kept the French at a distance;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
the sea was within sight, and the climate and
weather improved considerably. Moreover, provisions
had been sent forward from Corunna to
Betanzos, and the half-starved men received ample
food; so that, seeing all their troubles at an end,
they made the last march to Corunna, on the 11th,
with light hearts. But Moore had no such feelings,
for he had received the depressing news that
his ships, which he had ordered to come round
from Vigo to Corunna, and which he had expected
to find in the harbour, had been delayed by stress
of weather. Doubtful for how long he would have
to wait, and within how short a time Soult would
be able to bring overwhelming force against him,
the General prepared for the worst, making all
arrangements to fight, as well as for the immediate
embarkation of his army so soon as the ships
should arrive. The bridges outside Corunna were
blown up, and all stores, munitions of war, and
horses, which he would not be able to remove,
Moore caused to be destroyed.</p>

<p>On the 14th January the ships entered the
harbour, and the embarkation of the sick and
wounded, guns, cavalry horses, and transport
animals was proceeded with as quickly as possible.
Meanwhile Soult began to press in, and Moore,
seeing that he could not expect to embark all his
troops without a fight, selected a defensive position
some two miles outside Corunna. The four
days' rest, with good food, had had a wonderful
effect on his men; the stragglers had come in;
fresh arms and ammunition had been supplied
from the ample stores at Corunna; the sickly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
men had been sent to the ships; and the General
found that he still had 15,000 determined infantry
soldiers and nine guns wherewith to withstand
Soult's onslaught. All the morning of the 16th
the French were seen to be massing in front of
the position, but Soult apparently still feared to
attack, and Moore, thinking that he would not do
so, gave orders for the embarkation to continue.
Yet, an hour later, Soult's guns suddenly opened,
and his columns dashed forward. Moore, overjoyed
at the sight, and sure of victory, saw before
him a great and glorious finale to the painful
scenes which he had witnessed during the previous
weeks, and rode from point to point of the field,
giving his orders with calmness, and inspiring
confidence in all directions. For some time the
battle raged furiously; the French were as eager
for the fray as were the British; here and there
the latter were forced to give way, but re-forming
rapidly, turned again, and recovered the lost
ground. At length, the issue of the fight was no
longer doubtful; the French were driven back on
all sides; the order for a general advance of the
victorious British line was given, and was being
carried out, when Moore fell mortally wounded,
and Baird was also struck. Confusion followed,
further orders remained unissued, and when Hope,
the next senior, took command, it was too late to
continue the struggle. Prudence demanded that
he should withdraw the army and embark before
the French could recover and return to the attack,
and under cover of darkness the whole of the
British force, save only the outposts, were with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>drawn
from the position, and embarked. That
night and the following day were spent in getting
every one on board, and by the 18th January the
last of the troops covering the embarkation quitted
Corunna for England, Soult's guns opening on the
ships as they put to sea.</p>

<p>Thus ended Moore's last campaign, and those
who knew nothing of the General's original plan
considered the retreat to have been a disastrous
flight, yet Moore's plan succeeded completely. He
drew Napoleon and 70,000 men away from the
south and saved Lisbon from a French occupation,
which was the most that he ever expected to do.
The amount of hardship which his troops would
have to endure in the withdrawal to the coast,
perhaps he had not anticipated; but, had he
lived, doubtless he would have claimed that the
result was well worth the sacrifice, and if, moreover,
the victory over Soult at Corunna had been
completed, few would have been found to cavil at
his plans and operations.</p>

<p>The part played by the 51st in the battle of
Corunna, though small, was not unimportant.
The regiment stood in second line to the left rear
of Elvina, opposite to which village the fiercest of
the fighting took place, and where Moore received
his death-wound. Considering its position, its
losses were not heavy, only amounting to some
five-and-twenty men&mdash;mostly wounded. Neither
did the regiment suffer to such an extent in
casualties during the actual retreat as did most
other regiments of Baird's original force; and if,
as has been maintained, want of discipline was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
accountable for heavy losses during the retreat,
then the officers of the 51st had good reason to
be proud of the discipline of their corps. Their
three months' absence from England, however, had
lowered their numbers by 107 men, and many
gallant officers and soldiers suffered from the
effects of the hardships of this campaign to the
end of their days. Sam Rice, although he came
out of it unscathed, was an invalid for some
months afterwards, and was unable to pass the
doctors when his regiment was next sent on active
service. Yet, for this he must have remained ever
thankful, for the expedition in which the 51st took
part in the autumn of 1809 was, as will be shown,
productive of nothing except death and disease.</p>

<p>On disembarking in England after Corunna, the
regiment was assembled at Sandown Barracks, and
in April marched into Devonshire, being quartered
first at Kingsbridge and then at Berryhead. In
May it received the honour of the title of Light
Infantry, probably as a reward for its good services
in the Corunna campaign, and probably also as a
memorial to Sir John Moore, the exponent of everything
pertaining to light infantry, and the former
commanding officer of the regiment. The 71st was
made a light infantry regiment about the same
time, but previous to that there had only been
four regiments in the British army so designated,
and as light infantry they considered themselves
superior to all other regiments of the line. As
such they wore a distinctive uniform, which was
much like that of the old light infantry company;
and their special duties on active service were to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
be always in front of the army, gaining and keeping
touch with the enemy, fighting advanced- or
rear-guard actions when on the march, and forming
a chain of outposts round the army when halted.</p>

<p>The spring and early summer of 1809 were
spent by the 51st in recruiting the regiment up to
fighting strength, for when, in April, Sir Arthur
Wellesley returned to Portugal to continue the
war, it was not sufficiently strong to form part
of the expedition. By July, however, this difficulty
had been overcome, for the stories told of
the Corunna campaign had roused the fighting
spirit of the country, and vast numbers of militiamen
volunteered into the line. But when, in this
month, the 51st received a fresh call to arms,
it was not for Portugal, but for Holland, an
expedition having been fitted out for the purpose
of destroying the French fleet and arsenals in the
Scheldt. Sam Rice, who had just given up the
command of his company on promotion to Major,
did not accompany the regiment on this service,
but remained in command of the depôt at Berryhead
Barracks.</p>

<p>The Walcheren Expedition, as it was called,
proved a complete failure. Operations commenced
satisfactorily, and Flushing was bombarded and
captured in August; but, owing to misunderstanding
between the military and naval commanders
(the Earl of Chatham and Sir Richard
Strachan), the enemy was not pursued with energy,
and the troops (some 40,000 in number) were kept
idle on the island of Walcheren, until fever decimated
their ranks. In September the greater<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
part of the misdirected expedition returned to
England, and for several months afterwards the
men continued to die from Walcheren fever. The
unfortunate circumstances gave rise to the following
caustic epigram:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verseq">"Lord Chatham, with his sabre drawn,</p>
<p class="verse">Stood waiting for Sir Richard Strachan;</p>
<p class="verse">Sir Richard, longing to be at 'em,</p>
<p class="verse">Stood waiting for the Earl of Chatham."</p>
</div></div>

<p>So far the regiment's experiences of European
warfare had not been pleasant. Within a year
it had taken part in two campaigns, in each of
which, although it had acquitted itself honourably,
it had sustained weighty losses. Unlike many
other regiments, the 51st had no second battalion
upon which to draw to replace casualties, and consequently
it was not fit to proceed on active
service in the Peninsula until the end of 1810.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Sir Arthur Wellesley, in supreme
command of the allied armies, had been actively
engaged with the enemy from month to month,
and had won several hard-fought battles. He
successfully frustrated Soult's invasion of Portugal
by defeating him on the Douro, in May 1809, and
driving him out of Oporto. He gained a signal
victory over Marshal Victor at Talavera, in July;
and thence retreated for the winter to the banks
of the Agueda river, between Almeida and Ciudad
Rodrigo. In 1810 Lord Wellington (as he now
was) had for his opponent Marshal Massena, who
had been ordered to invade Portugal (while Soult
directed his attentions to Badajoz), and who, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
June, commenced operations by investing Ciudad
Rodrigo, then held by a Spanish garrison. Capturing
that fortress in July, Massena advanced
on the neighbouring Portuguese fortress of
Almeida, which also fell into his hands, Wellington's
advanced troops&mdash;the Light Division&mdash;being
forced back behind the Coa river after a desperate
combat. In September, however, Wellington
encountered his adversary at Busaco, thoroughly
defeated him, and then withdrew rapidly to the
impregnable lines of Torres Vedras, which, with
great foresight, he had caused to be thrown up
in front of Lisbon. Massena, ignorant of their
existence, and imagining that Wellington was
retreating for immediate embarkation, pressed
forward for the capture of the Portugese capital,
but only to find his way barred by a series of
strong fortifications. Behind these defences the
British army remained unmolested throughout
the winter, while the French, withdrawing to a
safe distance, sat down to await the coming of
spring. This, then, was the situation in Portugal
when the 51st Regiment, quartered at Steyning
Barracks, received orders to join Wellington's
army in the Peninsula; and by this time Major
Sam Rice was ready to be up and doing.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">CHAPTER VIII.</a><br />
<span class="center xs">CAMPAIGNS OF 1811 IN THE PENINSULA.</span></h2>

<p class="noindent">In January 1811 the 51st embarked at Portsmouth
for Lisbon in three of His Majesty's ships,
one of which (the <i>Danemark</i>), having on board
three companies under Major Rice, separated from
the fleet during a heavy gale, but eventually
reached its destination on the 19th February.
Lieut.-Colonel Mainwaring was in command of
the regiment, which left Lisbon early in March
to join Wellington's army, then advancing from
the lines of Torres Vedras in pursuit of Massena,
who, with the break-up of the winter, had secretly
withdrawn from his cantonments about Santarem,
leaving dummy sentries on outpost duty, in order
to deceive the British. But the <i>ruse</i> succeeded
for only a few hours, for the officers of the Light
Division, who, from across the Rio Mayor, had
been watching the enemy throughout the winter,
detected the men of straw through their "spy-glasses,"
reported that the French were in full
retreat, and immediately took up the pursuit.
Almost at once they were on the heels of Ney's
rearguard, engaged it at Pombal on the 11th
March, and at Redinha on the 12th, and fought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
again at Cazal Novo and Foz de Aronce<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> on the
14th and 15th; but Ney, who knew his business
only too well, never suffered himself to become
seriously embarrassed, his force always melting
away at the opportune moment, much to the
disgust of his pursuers.</p>

<p>The young soldiers, of whom the 51st was now
largely composed, made an early acquaintance
with the horrors of war, for a very few marches
brought them into the country through which the
French army had recently retreated, and signs of
cruelty to the Portuguese inhabitants and of wanton
destruction of property were visible everywhere.
Villagers, deprived of all that they
possessed, were left to die of starvation; and
towns and villages were ruthlessly set on fire.
Leyria was still in flames when the 51st passed
through it, and the road onwards was "broadly
marked by the putrefying carcases of dead French
soldiers stretched beside the wreck accumulated
by their wanton, shameful outrages." The regiment
joined Wellington's army at the village of
Carripinar, and on the 19th March the whole
force, except the two divisions still in close pursuit
of the enemy, assembled at Moita, where a
halt of some days was made, in order to obtain
supplies from Lisbon. On the 28th March a forward
movement brought the troops to Celorico,
when the 51st took its place in the 7th Division
(Major-General Houston), and on the following day
marched out with the centre column for the attack<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
on Guarda. The enemy, however, made no attempt
to defend the town, but withdrew at once, with
the loss of a considerable number of prisoners.</p>

<p>Still retreating rapidly, Massena took up a
position behind the Coa, and at Sabugal, on the
3rd April, Wellington attacked him with great
success, utterly defeating him, and two days
later forcing him to cross the frontier into Spain.
Wellington then commenced the investment of
Almeida, a Portuguese frontier fortress in possession
of the French, while Massena, unable to
feed his army on the country, retired to Salamanca.
All April was spent by the British force
in the vicinity of Almeida, and the following
extract from a letter written by Major Rice on
the 16th of the month, from "<em>Villa Mayor, upon
a branch of the Coa, and near Almeida</em>," will
help to show how the situation appeared to the
regimental officer:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"As you will have heard of all our operations
since Massena's flight, which was tolerably rapid,
it would be useless for me to attempt a recapitulation,
whose only merit would consist in incorrectness
and stupidity. You will see by the public
documents that no general action has taken place,
though much skirmishing with the advance, which
has always been to its credit and gallantry. Had
the gentlemen&mdash;I mean the French&mdash;not been so
very swift of foot, the business would have been
most decisive and glorious for those concerned,
as well as for the nation at large. The chase
has been given these several days. It is indeed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
even reported they have quitted Salamanca. The
whole of our army is now concentrated between
Almeida and Ciudad Rodrigo&mdash;fortresses in possession
of the enemy which still hold out. How
they are to be disposed of is all a secret, but of
this and all other matters of real importance you
will be better informed at home than I am here.
The whole tract of country passed by us since
we left Lisbon is completely devastated&mdash;scarce a
village or town that has not been fired by the
French. The beautiful city of Leyria, with its
convents and churches, has been made a dreadful
example of&mdash;immense and valuable libraries all
committed to the flames. For a collector of old
and mutilated manuscripts and parchments there
was a fine field, for they were kicking and blowing
about in all directions. The poor, half-famished
inhabitants literally vegetate in the
fields,&mdash;a sight more distressing than any I have
yet witnessed, and I thought till then that I had
been pretty familiar with every species of human
misery. It does not do to moralise, for such
things are the consequence of warfare, but I do
verily believe that never before was it conducted
with so much barbarism&mdash;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">au part des Français</i>,&mdash;the
bare details of which shock the most obdurate
and unfeeling heart. Lord Wellington and staff
have just passed us. He is going to the side of
Badajoz. Something, I conclude, of importance
has transpired that calls his attention in the
Alentejo. What is now to be done is mere
matter of speculation; time, as in everything,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
will discover. We are horribly fed, sometimes
three or four days without bread."</p></div>

<p>Again, on the 23rd April, he wrote from the
same place:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Still stationary; nothing whatever has transpired
of any moment in this quarter since my
last advice. Almeida continues invested; what
is to be the result, as I said before, I am ignorant
of. It is, however, pretty clear that no operations
have as yet begun as to indicate the
intention of a siege. One would suppose that
something must shortly be attempted, unless Lord
Wellington is informed as to the positive provisionment
of the garrison, by which the trouble
and the loss of heads may be spared. The French
are friendly, and give us no trouble. They occupy
a position on the Agueda with a corps of 4000
men&mdash;merely, I conclude, as a reconnaissance from
the main body of the army, which is at Salamanca
and in cantonments in the neighbourhood, or it
may be further, from what I know, so little do
we hear.</p>

<p>"His lordship we have heard nothing of since
his departure for the Alentejo. Some serious
errors have been committed, to the full extent
of which we remain in the dark. Much anxiety
is, of course, expressed. I trust things will not
prove so bad as report makes them, as any little
reverse gives encouragement to <em>our friends</em>. A
squadron of the 13th was surprised and taken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
near Badajoz lately; it was acting as a picket
to a division of our army; the consequence was
so far serious that the French cavalry pushed
through the cantonments of the infantry, who,
supposing themselves in security, were totally
unprepared, and gaped (wide enough, I daresay)
at the sight. A loss of a few ears, arms, old
hats, &amp;c., I conclude, took place, though as yet
no details of the reverse have arrived. It is a
d&mdash;d bad business, and won't bear telling.</p>

<p>"What a gallant business at Cadiz! Is it
not a pity so much good blood should be spilled
for those dastardly Spaniards? Ought not now
those zealous English fools in the cause of Spain
to be sickened, or do they want another bloody
fight, by way of ascertaining if British soldiers
will fight? The game of Spain must be up. Of
this country (Portugal) I shall not yet talk,
though its ultimate fate cannot but be foreseen.
But I must not discuss politics. The weather is
here dreadfully cold and unpleasant, though you
will scarce believe it from our geographical situation.
Guarda, from which we are distant but five
leagues, is supposed to be one of the highest cities
in Europe, so of our atmosphere I leave you to
judge. Hunger, misery, and grumbling is the
order of the day."</p></div>

<p>Wellington's departure for the Alentejo and
the events in the neighbourhood of Badajoz, to
which Rice refers in the above letters, had been
occasioned by the fact that while the pursuit of
Massena was being carried out, Soult, who had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
assembled a powerful army in the south of Spain,
advanced rapidly, and after defeating the Spaniards,
detached Mortier to besiege the fortress of
Badajoz, held by a Spanish garrison. On the
11th March the latter ignominiously surrendered,
and the French, having secured Badajoz, moved
on and captured Campo Mayor. A week later,
Wellington, seeing no chance of drawing Massena
into a general engagement, and thus feeling confident
that he could spare a portion of his force,
despatched Marshal Beresford with two divisions
of infantry and some cavalry and artillery towards
Campo Mayor. That fortress was reached on the
25th March, but the enemy did not await the
arrival of the British, who, seeing the French in
full retreat towards Badajoz, pushed on, and after
a brilliant cavalry charge captured the enemy's
convoy, only, however, to lose it again by rashly
pursuing too far and coming under the fire of
the guns of the fortress.</p>

<p>Early in April, Beresford began the investment
of Badajoz, but so many difficulties, real or imaginary,
lay in his way that before the investment
could be completed the French had ample time
to provision the place and repair its defences. It
was on the 7th April that the incident of the
capture of a squadron of the 13th occurred, and
Napier says of it that the French general, with
3000 infantry, 500 cavalry, and four guns, "surprised
a squadron of the 13th, which was in front,
and then came so close up to the main body as
to exchange shots; yet he was permitted to
retire unmolested, in the face of more than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
20,000 men!" Napier attaches no blame to the
13th Light Dragoons for what occurred, but
rather extols their gallantry. Of the supineness
and inactivity of Beresford in all these operations
he has, however, much to say; and Rice's
remarks point to the fact that camp rumours
were for once tolerably accurate.</p>

<p>With Wellington's arrival in front of Badajoz
on the 21st April new life was put into the
operations, for he gave orders to prosecute the
siege with all vigour before Soult could come to
the succour of the garrison. Requisites for the
siege, however, were not forthcoming in sufficient
quantities, for although guns, ammunition, and
entrenching tools had been ordered up from
Lisbon, the transport for their conveyance was
hopelessly inadequate. Yet the engineer officers
set to work to mark out the trenches, and were
preparing to break ground, when Wellington received
information from his northern army which
necessitated his immediate return to the neighbourhood
of Almeida. Leaving instructions, therefore,
with Beresford to delay the siege of Badajoz
for the time being, he hurried north, to find,
on his arrival, that Massena's activity was causing
considerable anxiety, for it was known that
the French marshal was advancing in strength
to raise the blockade of Almeida.</p>

<p>By the 28th April Wellington was back with
his army, and taking in the situation at once,
decided to give battle between the Agueda and
the Coa. Massena conducted his operations much
as his adversary had foreseen that he would do,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
and within the week was fought the battle of
Fuentes d'Onor,<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> on ground midway between
Ciudad Rodrigo and Almeida.</p>

<p>Hereabouts the river system is somewhat intricate,
no fewer than five considerable streams
flowing, in almost parallel channels, from south to
north. On the east the Agueda flows close by
the walls of Ciudad Rodrigo; westward of the
Agueda are its tributaries, the Azava, the Duas
Casas, and the Turon; and a little to the west
of Almeida is the Coa&mdash;all within a space of thirty
miles, and for the most part unfordable. As early
as the 24th April Massena had pushed forward his
advanced troops from Ciudad Rodrigo, with the
object of seizing the crossings of the Azava, but
the British outposts on that river drove them
back, and continued to hold the river line, until
Wellington arrived and selected a position behind
the Duas Casas, when the outposts gradually fell
back and allowed the French to advance. This
they did on the 2nd May, and, on the 3rd, succeeded
in crossing the Duas Casas at one point
and capturing the village of Fuentes. They did
not, however, remain long in possession, for after
a fierce fight the British drove them out and
forced them back across the Duas Casas.</p>

<p>Next day, Massena moved forward with 5000
cavalry and 40,000 infantry, and Wellington made
some alterations in his dispositions, so that his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
front now extended for a distance of some seven
miles. By this new arrangement, the 7th Division
(to which the 51st belonged) was placed on the
extreme right, near the hill of Nava de Avel,
opposite to which the French appeared to be
massing in strength. On the morning of the 5th
May Massena pushed on, and simultaneously attacked
the village of Fuentes and the right of the
British position. The 7th Division, outnumbered,
were forced back, but the Light Division and the
cavalry hastened to its support, and restored the
fight. Wellington, now observing that his right
was in imminent danger of being turned, ordered
the 7th Division to draw in, and the Light Division
covered the withdrawal in a magnificent manner.
The enemy's strong force of cavalry made strenuous
efforts to crush this portion of the line, and
what immediately occurred is best described in
the words of Napier. "The Light Division," he
says, "was thrown into squares; the Seventh
Division, which was more advanced, endeavoured
to do the same, but the horsemen were too quick
upon them, and some were cut down; the remainder
stood firm, and the Chasseurs Britannique
ranged behind a loose stone wall poured such a
fire that the French recoiled and seemed bewildered."</p>

<p>According to all accounts, the battle scene at
this phase of the fight was a most picturesque
one. The vast plain was covered with charging
bodies of horsemen, who once and again endeavoured
to break the squares, which, nothing
daunted, met the onslaught, and leisurely retired.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
But the grandest sight of all on that memorable
day was perhaps that presented by Norman
Ramsay's two-horse artillery guns, which, hemmed
in and cut off by the enemy's cavalry, saved
themselves, not by their fire, but by cleaving their
way at full gallop through the astonished French
horsemen. This was, however, but one incident
of many in a day of great deeds, and for a long
while the issue of the fight hung in the balance.
Failing to effect his purpose on the British right,
Massena directed his attention to the capture of
the village of Fuentes; but at this point also his
troops were eventually beaten back, and at nightfall
the British and French sentries, separated only
by the breadth of the Duas Casas, agreed to take
water from the river without molestation&mdash;a tacit
agreement which always existed in Peninsular warfare
between the veterans of the opposing armies.</p>

<p>Considering the critical situation in which the
7th Division was for so long placed, the casualties
in the 51st on this day were remarkably few&mdash;only
half a dozen wounded. In the briefest of
letters Sam Rice described the events in which
he had taken part as senior major of the regiment.
"We have suffered little," he wrote, "though the
first attack was made on our regiment by a body of
cavalry, who came up to the charge, but were soon
convinced that we were not to be trifled with. I
am well and safe. I had an 'all-but,' having my
cap whisked off by a three-pounder, but received
no other injury than a temporary stunning from
the concussion. The French again menaced us
this morning, but it has since proved a mere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
manœuvre, and they are off, and we prepared to
follow. I literally have not time to say more."</p>

<p>This was written on the day after the battle,
and it is possible that the writer was too sick at
heart to say more; for something had occurred,
as will be disclosed a little later on, which must
have caused endless regret to every officer of the
regiment who came out of action. They were not,
however, given much time to brood over their
misfortune, for on the 10th May Massena gave up
the attempt to reach Almeida, and withdrew his
army beyond the Agueda, when he was relieved
of his command by Marmont. That same night,
Brenier, in command of Almeida, seeing that
there was now no hope of succour reaching him,
resolved on a bold stroke. Having destroyed the
guns of the fortress, he marshalled the garrison,
and, in one solid mass, at dead of night, broke
through the blockading force, almost before any
one was aware of what was taking place, and
eventually made his escape with only a few casualties.
Wellington, disgusted at the escape of the
garrison, vented his wrath on his lax troops in no
measured terms, and leaving Sir Brent Spencer
with a sufficient force to watch Marmont, despatched
the remainder of the army to Badajoz,
the siege of which he proposed to renew at
once.</p>

<p>While Wellington was fighting Massena at
Fuentes d'Onor, much had been going on in the
neighbourhood of Badajoz, and Wellington, although
seemingly so fully occupied in the north,
was at the same time planning for the overthrow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
of Soult in the south. It will be remembered
that when he hurriedly left Badajoz, at the end
of April, to attend to Massena, he instructed
Beresford to prosecute the siege leisurely. Certainly
Beresford could do no more, since, as has
been said, he lacked all the requisites for a regular
siege, but he attempted more, and failed ignominiously.
From the 5th to the 12th May the first
siege of Badajoz was carried on without sufficient
organisation, and assaults were directed on various
points before they had been properly breached,
with the result that within the week Beresford
had lost nearly a thousand men, and had made no
impression on the fortress. Then came the news
that Soult was moving to the relief of the garrison,
when Beresford at once raised the siege, marched
south, and prepared to give battle. On the 16th
May was fought the memorable and bloody battle
of Albuhera (or Albuera), where, more by good
luck than good management, Beresford, with a
loss of four thousand of his eight thousand men,
succeeded in defeating his adversary, whose losses
were still heavier. The investment of Badajoz
was now resumed, and Wellington was soon on
the spot, making arrangements for a second siege.</p>

<p>Badajoz at this time was probably the strongest
fortress on the Spanish frontier. It was situated
on the south bank of the Guadiana, a broad and
deep river, which was of itself considered to be
sufficient protection from an attack from the
north. On that side, therefore, the defences of
the fortress consisted only of a simple rampart.
On all other sides the fortifications were formid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>able,
having regular bastioned fronts, with solid
masonry parapets, encircled by a ditch in places
thirty feet deep. Within the north-east angle of
the fortress stood the ancient castle, built on a
hillock one hundred feet in height, and overlooking
the Guadiana; yet, in its turn, overlooked
by the high ground (barely five hundred yards
distant) to the north of the river. In order to
guard against the possibility of an enemy's
artillery occupying these heights and demolishing
the castle, a detached fort, known as St Christoval
(or San Christobal), had been built on them; while,
on the opposite side of Badajoz, there were two
detached works&mdash;Pardeleras on the south, and
Picurina on the south-east.</p>

<p>In the first siege, Beresford had attempted to
attack from the north, capture St Christoval, and,
after establishing batteries, breach and assault the
castle. St Christoval, however, proved too strong
for the assailants, and thus Beresford was forced
to leave his work undone. When Wellington
came on the scene to prepare for the second
siege, he decided to follow Beresford's plan, and
accordingly, on the 24th May, the 7th Division
invested St Christoval. Trenches were now
commenced towards the castle and towards St
Christoval, and batteries were soon erected.
During the first few days of June the trenchwork
made rapid progress, and the guns fired
continuously on the castle and on the fort. On
the 6th June, a practicable breach in St Christoval
was reported, and the assault was ordered to
take place forthwith.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>

<p>On the night of the 6th-7th, the assault was
launched, Major Macintosh, of the 85th, commanding
the Stormers, and Ensign Dyas, of the
51st, the Forlorn Hope. The advanced party
succeeded in dropping into the ditch undiscovered,
and the Stormers with their escalading ladders
followed close behind, but on reaching the breach
it was found that the defenders had succeeded in
repairing it, and had added to its summit a high
perpendicular wall&mdash;so high that the ladders would
not nearly reach the top. Then the enemy's
musket-fire fell upon the unfortunate Stormers, and
shells, rolled from the ramparts, bursting amongst
them, played havoc in the ranks. Retreat was
inevitable, and upwards of a hundred dead and
wounded were left in the ditch.</p>

<p>Next day the guns reopened fire on St Christoval,
and on the 9th June a second assault was
ordered. Ensign Dyas again led the Forlorn Hope,
and Major M'Geechy, of the 11th, the Stormers.
The ladders carried were much longer than those
used on the previous occasion, yet they did not
prove long enough; for the defenders had removed
the débris from the foot of the breach and thus
rendered the place safe from escalade. Shot and
shell now rained on the baffled assailants, but,
nothing daunted, they reared their ladders and
pressed up them, in the attempt to reach the
rampart&mdash;only, however, to be bayoneted at the
top, or to be hurled backwards into the ditch as
the defenders pushed the ladders away. The
disaster was complete. M'Geechy was killed,
and ere the troops could extricate themselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
from the ditch hundreds had fallen. Of the 51st
alone there fell in these two desperate assaults
one officer killed and three officers wounded,
twenty-six men killed and seventy wounded; but
Dyas, the hero of two Forlorn Hopes, escaped
unharmed, and was personally complimented by
Wellington for his gallantry.</p>

<p>Major Sam Rice, who had taken an active
part in these assaults, wrote, in his usual laconic
way, from <em>Camp before Badajoz, 16th June
1811</em>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The siege of this place, which began under
such favourable auspices, I am sorry to say, is
not likely to terminate yet awhile, and, if at all,
only by starvation, for it is most ably defended,
beyond, I believe, the calculations of the scientifics.
We opened fire from our batteries on the 2nd June,
and proceeded to batter and destroy, but without
much effect, for the guns and all apparatus are
withdrawn within these last three days. The cause
is said to be that Marshal Soult is again coming
forward with a determination to dispute the point,
and afford relief to the garrison; but before this
a general action must be fought, and a bloody one
it will be, for on this depends the fate of Badajoz
and of the frontier&mdash;at any rate for a time. The
place still continues invested, but all expect to
move directly to the army in front. We have
been most cruelly harassed day and night, and
totally uncovered, as well as exposed to a most
scorching sun. Our Regiment has suffered much
in two unsuccessful attempts to storm a fort&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
100 men killed and wounded, and several officers.
I have escaped wonderfully, though never under
a hotter fire in all my life. I am writing from the
bare ground, on which I have taken up my abode
this last month entirely. Mainwaring is sick; I
command the Regiment, reduced already to 300&mdash;so
much for honour and glory!"</p></div>

<p>Almost immediately after this letter was written,
Wellington, learning that Marmont had come down
and united with Soult, raised the siege, and withdrew
his force rapidly, a few miles, to the Caya
river, and on the 19th June the French armies
entered Badajoz. The combination against Wellington
was now weighty. Soult and Marmont could
put sixty thousand men into the field, whereas
the Allies on the Caya could not muster half that
number. But the French marshals failed to discover
this weakness, and Wellington found the
ground about the Caya so favourable that he was
able to present a bold front and deceive his
opponents as to his actual strength, which, even
after Spencer joined him with the force left in the
neighbourhood of Almeida, stood at no more than
twenty-eight thousand fighting men. Unwilling
to risk a battle without knowing the actual
strength of their adversary, Soult and Marmont
made no attempt to advance, but shortly afterwards
retired and separated, to commence a new
plan of campaign.</p>

<p>The following letter from Major Rice gives his
views on the situation about this time:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<br />
<p class="xs right">"<span class="smcap">Campo Mayor</span>, <em>19th July 1811</em>.</p>

<p>"Since my last we have been tolerably quiet;
scarce even alarms, which have their advantages
in keeping the body and soul in that activity so
essential to the military character. It seems now
pretty well ascertained that the French army is
broken up for the present. Soult, with a corps,
reoccupies Seville. Marmont, with the remaining
force, Plasencia and its neighbourhood. By an
intercepted letter from Marmont, and which is
said to be authentic, he complains much of the
disorganisation of his army, and want of resources
of every kind, and particularly money, without
which he can anticipate no future good. I suppose
the gentlemen soldiers begin to grumble&mdash;pay or
plunder is the cry. For my part, I've heard so
much of armies being annihilated, want of pay,
food, and clothing, &amp;c., &amp;c., and cowed at even
the sight of British troops, all which statements
have proved so incorrect by pretty fair experience,
that I now give ear to nothing that is said, however
apparently good the authority. Whatever
may be their motives, one thing is pretty certain
and known to both parties&mdash;that no active warfare
can be carried on at this season of the year
in the Alentejo without mutual destruction. The
campaign may probably open again early in the
autumn. On what point the attack is likely to
be made, I as little care as I am able to form an
opinion, but wherever it is, they will certainly get
cursedly licked. So much for presumption! The
whole of our army, which has been <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'biovouacking'">bivouacking</ins>
in this vicinity, is now nearly in motion, standing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
by divisions along the frontier, to Castello Branco
and beyond.</p>

<p>"We march to-morrow for Nissa (or Niza), a
town this side the Tagus, and near one of the
principal fords, Villa Velha. The weather is most
dreadfully hot. Crowded, and stenched out by
all sorts of agreeables&mdash;dead animals, &amp;c.&mdash;our
situation is not the most delectable one. Withal,
bad fare, and every article exorbitantly dear. Mainwaring
has got a staff appointment, and an officer
from half-pay has been brought in. What satisfaction
is there in serving if it has not its reward?
I am fairly sick of the business. I have had nothing
but losses of late. A valuable horse broke
from me while at Badajoz, swam the Guadiana,
and I believe is now in the French lines. Poor
Harry's<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> pistol, which I had in my sash the night
of the storm (St Christoval), dropped out, and I
lost also my poor dear Mary's<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> snuff-box, which
I considered almost as my guardian angel, it
having been my companion in every affair."</p></div>

<p>The latter part of this letter helps to throw
light on Sam Rice's character, and it is evident
from it that he was a man who bore no ill-will
to any one. He mentions casually that "an
officer from half-pay has been brought in," and
he immediately dismisses the subject with, "I am
fairly sick of the business," and never refers to it
again. Yet he, the senior major of the 51st, had
been passed over for the command of the regiment,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>and Lieut.-Colonel Mitchell, who had had no
previous connection with the regiment, had been
brought in over his head. Under such circumstances
an ordinary man might have been excused
if he had given vent to his feelings by filling two
or three sheets of paper with abuse of every one in
authority. Major Rice was the victim of circumstances;
by no fault of his own he had lost the
command of his regiment; but he was above all
things loyal, and he refused to give away his commanding
officer, Colonel Mainwaring. He says
nothing whatever of any trouble. On the 16th
June he writes, "Mainwaring is sick; I command
the Regiment"; and on the 19th July, "Mainwaring
has got a staff appointment." It would
have been easy for him to have told the whole
story, and thus excused himself, as certainly nine
out of ten people would have done. He, however,
chose the better part, and left unsaid anything
that might have detracted from the conduct of his
commanding officer, and anything that might have
been seized upon by gossip-mongers as affecting
the good name of the Regiment.</p>

<p>In later years Sir John Colborne related what
took place in the following words:<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a>&mdash;"Colonel
Mainwaring, of the 51st, was placed in a position
[Battle of Fuentes de Oñoro] in which he thought
he was sure to be surrounded by the French. So
he called his officers and said, 'we are sure of
being taken or killed; therefore we'll burn the
colours.' Accordingly, they brought the colours<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
and burnt them with all funeral pomp, and buried
the ashes, or kept them, I believe. It so happened
that the French never came near them. Lord
Wellington was exceedingly angry when he heard
of it, as he knew well enough where he had placed
the regiment. So he ordered Mainwaring under
arrest and tried him by court-martial. An old
colonel, who undertook his defence, said, 'I believe
it was something to do with religious principles.'
'Oh,' said Lord Wellington, 'if it was a matter
of religious principles, I have nothing more to do
with it. You may take him out of arrest; but
send him to Lisbon.' So he went to Lisbon, and
was never allowed to command his regiment again;
he was sent home."</p>

<p>Such is the story, and there is little doubt that
when Sam Rice wrote, on the 16th June, that he
was in temporary command, as Mainwaring was
sick, he knew perfectly well that his commanding
officer, although he certainly had been invalided to
Lisbon, had been virtually relieved of his command.
But the authorities, evidently unwilling to be too
severe on an officer who had performed good
services for his country, but who had erred through
excess of zeal, so arranged matters that, on the
13th June 1811, Lieut.-Colonel Mainwaring exchanged
to the half-pay of the 26th Foot (with
Lieut.-Colonel Mitchell) and was appointed commandant
of Hilsea Barracks in England. The
matter, of course, had to be referred home, and
so took some time, and in the meanwhile Colonel
Mainwaring had taken his regiment to the camp
before Badajoz, and had been hurt in the trenches.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p>Now, as a matter of fact, Sir John Colborne was
wrong in saying that "the French never came
near them," for it is perfectly certain that the 7th
Division was posted in a most perilous position,
and was very seriously attacked, although certainly
the 51st was not so desperately engaged as were
some of the other regiments. The division, numbering
some four thousand infantry (of whom the
51st and 85th were the only British regiments),
and supported by fourteen hundred cavalry, was
detached two miles from the main position, on
practically open ground, and every one in the
division knew that since Wellington's left flank
was impregnable, Massena would, of necessity,
direct his attack on the right flank. Wellington
himself was well aware of this, but either he did
not anticipate so vast a turning movement as his
adversary eventually launched, or he had intended
that the 7th Division should only hold the outlying
position assigned to it long enough to induce
Massena to develop his attack against it. Be that
as it may, the fact remains that, at one time, the
7th Division was threatened by twenty thousand
of Massena's infantry and nearly the whole of his
masses of cavalry, and for a while was in imminent
danger of being cut off and annihilated. Wellington,
of course, set matters right as soon as he
realised that the situation was becoming critical,
but there were some who imagined that he was
intensely annoyed at having made faulty dispositions
in the first instance, and that he endeavoured
to justify himself in the eyes of the 7th Division
by venting his wrath on the colonel of the 51st.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
At the same time the burning of the colours was
an extraordinary procedure on the part of the
colonel, and it is not easy to understand how it
was that the other senior officers of the regiment
acquiesced in it, if, indeed, they did so. When
the circumstances became known to Wellington, he
was bound to take notice of what had occurred;
but apparently the officers of the 51st considered
that he was unduly severe in treating
their colonel's action as anything more than an
error of judgment, for which a reprimand might
have been sufficient. As it was, they always
maintained that the commander-in-chief had been
harsh and unjust, because it had been represented
to him that Colonel Mainwaring had doubted the
wisdom of his dispositions.</p>

<p>Years afterwards his nephew, Frederick Mainwaring,<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a>
who, when only fourteen years of age,
fought as an ensign of the 51st at Fuentes d'Onor
and elsewhere, wrote very strongly on the subject,
and referred to the incident of the burning of the
colours, though without actually mentioning what
had occurred, in the following words:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"An action, in which this officer took the greatest
responsibility upon himself, and which ought
to have reflected credit upon him rather than
annoyance, was misrepresented to the great Duke,
who, with all his bright qualities, is said (if report<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
does not greatly belie him) never to alter an
opinion or a resolution once formed."<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></p></div>

<p>Colonel Mainwaring was not the only commanding
officer in the Peninsula who was troubled by
the presence of his regimental colours in the field,
for there were occasions upon which the colours
hampered the movements of a regiment very considerably.
In action they could never be neglected,
since they were held to contain, as it were, the
soul of the regiment. Originally used as the rallying-point,
they had gradually come to be regarded
as what nowadays would be termed the <em>mascot</em>
of the regiment, so that their loss in battle was
thought likely to lead to the most dire consequences.
The officers who carried them knew that they were
in honour bound to defend them to the last, and
when a whole regiment was ordered to skirmish to
the front, it was often necessary to leave a company
behind to guard the colours. As the war in
the Peninsula went on, light infantry regiments
realised that their colours were an encumbrance,
and observing that rifle regiments were not provided
with colours, some of them got permission
to place theirs in store. But this was exceptional,
and most regiments continued to carry their colours
into action. At Waterloo they were everywhere
conspicuous, and even in modern times their defence
in the field has led to fierce fighting and the
performance of signal acts of gallantry. Now,
however, the extended battlefield has made their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
presence an impossibility, and they are no longer
taken on active service. Perhaps, in this way,
the sentiment attached to the "flag that bore the
battle and the breeze" has been rudely crushed;
yet the colours of to-day, emblazoned with numerous
battle honours, are useful in reminding the
young soldiers of a regiment of the victories won
by their ancestors.</p>

<p>Whether, as a result of this trouble over the
51st colours at Fuentes d'Onor, Rice suffered to
any great extent by being passed over for the
command of the regiment is questionable. He
certainly did not succeed to the command for
another six years; but, if nothing had occurred,
Colonel Mainwaring could have continued to hold
it for that length of time, or for even longer.
The fact of another officer having been brought
in over his head did not reflect on Rice's character
as an officer, for it always has been well
known to every one in the service that an outside
officer must take the place of a commanding
officer relieved of his command; and it will readily
be understood that such an arrangement is a
necessity. As we shall see, the authorities made
it up to Rice in more ways than one, and he eventually
received as many decorations and honours
as he would have received if he had succeeded
Colonel Mainwaring<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> in the command of the 51st.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>
<p>Having failed to reduce Badajoz, Wellington
decided to invest Ciudad Rodrigo, and towards
that place his troops were now moving. The
51st marched from Campo Mayor to Sabugal,
and thence proceeded to Alfayates and Villa
Mayor, at which latter place the regiment remained
throughout the greater part of August
and September, as will be seen from the two
following letters from Major Rice, who during
this time was in temporary command of the
regiment:&mdash;</p>

<p>"My last (from Campo Mayor, I believe) informed
you that, the foe being no longer to be
dreaded in that quarter, the army was moving
into cantonments along the frontier, and that we
(that is, the 7th Division) were to occupy Nissa,
or Niza. Such did take place, and all indulged
in the fond hope that we should enjoy a little
<em>otium</em> for a month or so; but, alas, it is willed
otherwise, for we are once more in motion, and
are so far advanced northwards, retracing our
footsteps to the Coa. What is to be done, or
the cause of this sudden movement, is a mystery,
and I believe only known to the Lord of Lords&mdash;<em>in
this country</em>, N.B.! I do not myself think any
serious attack will again be made by <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Monsieur

ruse of Baron Douro's to distract him&mdash;harass&mdash;or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
what you will, and causing a 'diversion in

may be the cause, it is no little annoyance
to be so constantly on the march in this hot
weather, and in a country more wretched than
you can possibly imagine. Not an article of any
description is to be purchased, and were it not
for our rations we should be literally starved.
We have not been under a roof for this some
time; every day we take up fresh ground, and
seek shelter in the woods, which luckily abound,
or we should actually be grilled alive. As yet
I have held out tolerably well, being unwilling
to give in while there is a prospect of anything
going on. How long I shall last I cannot say,
for we are all getting sickly. The Regiment has

<p>"I wish I could convey to you anything new
and interesting relative to this country, or what
is likely to be the result of such apparently protracted
operations. I am most positively in the
utmost obscurity; mystery is the order of the
day, really I believe because no one but the lord
of lords is enlightened, and I sometimes doubt
whether he is always so, such is the fluctuating
state of Spain, and probably the difficulty of gain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>ing
intelligence of the real movements of the foe.
The whole army still remains cantoned upon this
frontier; the advance upon the Agueda, with
pickets probably as far as Ciudad Rodrigo. They
talk of a siege, but I do not hear of the arrival
of the battering train, which may possibly be
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en route</i> from Oporto. You will hardly suppose
us to be in such ignorance, but true it is, for one
division scarce knows how the other is posted;
but as there is one tolerable fair directing head,
it is of no moment of what materials are composed
those who act in so confined a sphere.</p>

<p>"The French don't appear to have made any
movement, still occupying Plasencia and the
contiguous country. Ciudad Rodrigo has but a
garrison of 1500 men. A considerable body at
Salamanca, but nothing to oppose us if we choose
to invest that place or make an advance, which
is not, I think, likely. The French to do anything
here must assemble in great force and bring
forward their supplies, which you know is difficult
in any country, much more so in such a barren
desert as this is. The grand puzzle now is, what
has been the cause of this rapid and unexpected
movement from the Tagus to the Coa, when
every one supposed we should be resting till the
autumn? Be sure to send the fishing-rod. I'm
longing to whip the Coa."</p></div>

<p>From this letter, as well as from many other
letters, one sees how very little was known, even
to senior officers of regiments, as to what was
going on, or what was likely to happen. This is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
a matter which is often forgotten by the layman,
who is apt to think, when reading the history of
a campaign, that the regimental officers failed
on certain occasions to appreciate the situation,
and therefore failed to do the right thing at the
right moment. Whereas, in nine cases out of
ten, in all probability the regimental officers were
completely in the dark as to the intentions of the
commander of the forces; and if the officers knew
little of the operations in progress, or of the
reason for movements, the men in the ranks
knew still less. Thus we constantly find in the
Peninsular letters and journals of regimental
officers and soldiers&mdash;at any rate at the beginning
of the war&mdash;expressions of distrust in the
generals, grumblings at having to perform forced
marches for no apparent reason, and disgust at
being ordered to retreat at the moment when
they expected to give battle. But, as the war
progressed, the men learned to take things as
they came, and made no attempt to reason out
the whys and the wherefores of strategical movements.
The discipline which had been drilled
into the soldiers taught them that it was not
necessary for them to exercise their reasoning
powers until they were in actual touch with the
enemy, and the officers seldom thought ahead
of the immediate tactical situation.</p>

<p>It must be remembered that a century ago few
of the rank and file could read or write, and few
of the regimental officers were students of the
theory of the art of war. It was not possible,
therefore, for these officers and men to work out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
any great strategical scheme, especially as they
had no means of learning anything of the enemy's
movements going on at a distance. Hints and
rumours filtered through from the staff officers,
and were greedily seized upon for discussion in
the bivouacs, but in the generality of cases they
were quite erroneous and frequently misleading.
So the regimental officers contented themselves
with living in the present, without troubling about
problems of strategy, and they were quite unable
to fathom the mystery of the part played by
politics in the war. It will be noticed that Sam
Rice, at the time a senior regimental officer, in
his letters declines to discuss politics, and says
little about strategy.</p>

<p>In the vast store of literature dealing with
the Peninsular War, there are many volumes of
officers' letters and journals, principally of officers
who served on the staff, and so to a certain
extent behind the scenes. Moreover, the majority
of these books were written up and edited years
after the war had come to an end, and after
every movement in the various campaigns had
been thoroughly discussed. There are few books
by regimental officers containing their views
written down at the time and not altered before
publication, and in such as there are we find
questions of strategy either avoided or dismissed
in a few words, and even questions of tactics
only vaguely referred to. For but vaguely did
these regimental officers ever know whither they
were going, or for what purpose, from one month's
end to the next. It was enough for them to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
told that their regiment would march at a certain
hour in a certain direction, and that what would
happen afterwards would depend on circumstances.
As soon as touch was gained with the enemy, the
regimental officers and the men were given a
general idea of the existing tactical situation and
what it was intended that they should do. But
even then they were not told all, and as often
as not they went into action knowing no more
about the dispositions of the enemy than they
could see with their own eyes. Consequently
there were occasions when, with a little more
information&mdash;a slight dispersal of the "fog of
war"&mdash;they might have crushed their enemy
beyond recovery, instead of merely crippling
him.</p>

<p>Why information about the enemy should have
been withheld it is difficult to understand, and
it must have been most irritating. Of the intentions
of their great chief, officers and men
never expected to be informed, and they had
neither the desire nor the ability to probe into
them. To Wellington himself this inability on
the part of his army to forecast his plans was
probably an immense satisfaction, for, he must
have argued, if his own troops could not see
through the veil, it was not likely that the enemy
would be able to do so. And, naturally, for a
general to be sure that his plans are kept secret,
with a possibility of his being able to blind and
deceive his adversary, is a great asset in war.
On the other hand, it is an undoubted fact that
Wellington carried this matter of reticence to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
extremes; he seldom took even his staff into his
confidence; any information which he collected
he kept to himself; and only on rare occasions
did he discuss his plans with anyone. The
wisdom of such an attitude on the part of a
commander-in-chief may, of course, be questioned,
on the grounds that if he were unfortunate
enough to be killed at the critical moment, the
next senior officer would be in the awkward predicament
of having to formulate a plan of his
own on the spur of the moment. It may be
argued that Wellington's plans were so thoroughly
worked out in every detail that there was no
loophole for failure, and no doubt as to what was
intended. That may have been so; but there is
no proof, for fortunately it was never put to the
test, and the great man saw all his plans brought
to a finish. Still, it is well known that Wellington
realised to the full the danger of his policy
of reticence; and it is on record that he himself
expressed the opinion that had he been placed
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">hors de combat</i> by the shot which passed over his
head and wounded Lord Uxbridge at Waterloo,
the British and their Allies would have suffered
defeat. His generals may have chafed under such
an autocratic rule, yet they, as well as the whole
army, had absolute confidence in their leader&mdash;at
any rate after the first year or two.</p>

<p>But the "grand puzzle" about which Rice
wrote on the 19th August was not so intricate as
he seems to have thought; for Wellington had
made up his mind all along to attempt the capture
of Ciudad Rodrigo, and had only cantoned his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
troops about the Tagus in order to deceive the
enemy as to his intentions. He was now moving
his army up towards the fortress with all speed,
hoping to reduce it before it could be re-victualled
for a siege. But in this he failed, for a convoy of
stores of all kinds had reached the place while
Wellington's troops were still at a distance from it.
The 51st had remained at Villa Mayor until the
22nd September, had then marched to Guinaldo,
and on 25th to Albergueria. Rice by this time
had been forced to go to hospital, and on the 26th
September he wrote from Aldea da Ribeira: "I
have been confined to my bed for these eight days
with a violent attack of dysentery, accompanied by
a good deal of fever. I think the former is in
some measure conquered. Am taking bark, for I
am most terribly low and hipped&mdash;all alone in a
most miserable village. How I shall get on I
know not. The task is arduous for an invalid in
this most horrid of countries. The regiment is a
league in advance; a retreat or an action must
take place within twenty-four hours, for the
French are only distant five leagues from our
outposts. Our army is in a wretched state; they
say 30,000, with an immensity of officers, sick; in
short, you see nothing from morning to night but
misery. You must not consider my case desperate,
so I beg of you not to alarm Fanny."<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></p>

<p>His next letter was from <em>Celorico, upon the
Mondego, 12th October 1811</em>&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p><div class="blockquot">

<p>"I gave you a few hasty lines, I think, on the
26th September. As I predicted that a retreat or an
action would take place within twenty-four hours,
so it happened. The French pushed forward in great
force, and would gladly have brought on an action,
but a wise head said nay, and we retrograded.
The 3rd Division was pressed hard by the cavalry,
but retired in good order by squares, so suffered
not so much as might have been expected. The
French have again taken themselves off, Marmont
by the pass of Banos to Plasencia, and the Comte
d'Orsini<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> (or some such name), with the remaining
force, is gone into cantonments in the vicinity of
Salamanca. What will be the end of all this
kicking about and expense of shoe leather I cannot
say. Our advanced posts extend nearly as far as
before, though several divisions are on this side of
the Coa, where I think they will remain for the
winter, or until some fresh alarm calls us again
into motion. I have been very unwell since my
last, but am now considerably better, and have to
complain principally of weakness. Another fortnight
will, I hope, put the old horse once more on
his legs. The best of them cannot go for ever.
His lordship is just coming in to inspect the
hospitals."</p></div>

<p>Shortly after this the 51st went into winter
quarters at Pena Macor, while Wellington perfected
his arrangement for converting the blockade
of Ciudad Rodrigo into a siege. That the regimental
officers did not take a very bright view of
the situation is evident from the following letter
from Major Rice:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquot">
<br />
<p class="xs right">"<span class="smcap">Pena Macor</span>, <em>4th December 1811</em>.</p>

<p>"We have got papers down to the 15th
November. Grand news was expected, such as
Northern Coalition&mdash;the old joke! I wish we
could get those Russian bears on foot; nothing
can be done here but by something of the sort.
Bony, I fear, is too deep, and John Bull such a
cursed fool that I am no longer sanguine in the
cause and the issue of the glorious struggle. The
army has again been on the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">qui vive</i>, but nothing
done. A convoy of provisions was attempted to
be thrown into Ciudad Rodrigo, but our lord was
too deep. He has good intelligence and certain
requisites. General Renaud passed some days here
with us. He likes good living and plenty of wine&mdash;a
tolerable sort of Frenchman. He was taken
by Don Julian, the famous guerilla partisan. He
thinks Bony will never forgive him, and is alarmed.
I shall struggle on a little longer before I give in&mdash;take
another round or two&mdash;the odds against me.
My poor brother major<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> died the other day&mdash;a
short illness, which terminated with a melancholy
disease&mdash;what the wigs call <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">timor orsi</i>&mdash;otherwise,
fear of hell."</p></div>

<p>So 1811 closed, and was followed by a year of
strenuous work for the British troops&mdash;a year of
great victories, yet one also of arduous marches,
vast hardships, and heavy casualties. And Major
Sam Rice managed to "struggle on" to the end
of it.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">CHAPTER IX.</a><br />
<span class="center xs">CIUDAD RODRIGO AND BADAJOZ.</span></h2>

<p class="noindent">While resting in cantonments when no operations
were in immediate prospect, the army in the
Peninsula forgot its hardships, and indulged in
such recreations and amusements as it was found
possible to organise. Everything was done by the
officers to keep up the spirits of the men, though,
since the age of playing games had not yet come,
there was little for them to do, beyond repairing
their clothing and shoes preparatory to the next
campaign. The officers, however, were able to
amuse themselves in a variety of ways; when not
on short rations most regiments kept a certain
number of pointers and greyhounds, and many of
the officers shot and coursed regularly; fishing was
also to be had in the rivers and streams; and each
division usually kept a scratch pack of hounds.
Wellington himself throughout the war hunted a
pack which he had got out from England, and in
many parts of the country provided excellent
sport for his headquarter staff and any officers
who cared to join in. Nor were balls and other
social entertainments forgotten, and whenever a
portion of the army was in the neighbourhood of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
a town the Spanish ladies showed no unwillingness
to enjoy gaieties offered to them. But perhaps
the greatest amusement was that provided by
private theatricals, which were held on every
possible occasion for the entertainment of the men.
Several divisions had their own theatres, the parts
of both sexes being played by the officers, and
everything being done well&mdash;even to printed programmes.
With such recreations, and with periodical
race meetings, the idle time passed pleasantly
enough; and when the men were again called upon
to take up arms, they did so cheerfully and with
renewed vigour.</p>

<p>During this winter of 1811-12, however, the
officers of the 51st had few opportunities of hunting,
for, until the first week of January, they were
kept at Pena Macor on the look-out for the enemy,
in daily expectation of receiving orders to march.
Still, they managed to enjoy themselves, as is
vouched for by one of the ensigns. "We led a
most agreeable life," says young Mainwaring;
"the neighbourhood abounding in game, our days
were spent in coursing and shooting. In the
evening there was always a party at someone's
quarters, where cigars, egg-wine, and good-humour
generally sent half of us tipsy to bed. Three times
a-week a division club, formed by the German
Light Brigade in an empty convent, added to our
amusements, and brought us all together. Here
was dancing, music, and cards; a faro bank for
those who were disposed to lose their money; two
military bands for the youngsters to dance to:
and a sutler's room, where was every species of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
refreshment at most moderate prices. Many a
wild mad scene have I been witness to, and
perhaps partaker in, at this club, but all was in
perfect good-humour; no arguments or strife;
nothing but the ebullition of health and youth.
Our generals and our superior officers joined in
and added to all our pleasures and amusements,
as in the field they shared all our privations and
hardships."</p>

<p>On the 9th January Major Rice wrote hastily&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"We are once more on the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">qui vive</i>; the siege
of Ciudad Rodrigo has commenced. What will be
the issue must depend on circumstances. Marmont,
it is supposed, has gone to the relief of Count
Suchet in Catalonia. Our lord, I conclude, thinks
it a fair opportunity of doing somewhat, all of
which you will hear in due time, and in an official
shape&mdash;much better than through private hand, at
all events such an one as mine. We have (I mean
our division) no orders as yet to quit our present
position; possibly relief, support, or succour may
be required. If so, we heroes, tried and valiant,
shall fly."</p></div>

<p>On the following day came the long-awaited
orders to move, and the 7th Division, marching
through Sabugal and Alfayates, reached Guinaldo
on the 13th January, and thence pushed on
towards Ciudad Rodrigo. The division, however,
was not destined to take part in the actual siege
operations, or in the terrific assault which terminated
them, its special duty being to stand off and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
cover the siege of the fortress by guarding the
passes of the Sierra de Gaeta against an inroad
by the enemy from that direction. The 51st,
with their headquarters at the village of Pajo,
furnished four officers' piquets on the mountains
in front of the two principal passes, in situations
fully exposed to the rigours of winter, the ground
covered with several feet of snow, and wolves
howling round the sentries throughout the night.
Yet in after years the officers looked back on
this unpleasant duty almost with pleasure, remembering
only that, when not on piquet, they
enjoyed excellent woodcock shooting!</p>

<p>Meanwhile Wellington had pushed on the siege
works with astounding rapidity, had effected
practicable breaches several days earlier than he
expected, and on the evening of the 19th January
assaulted and carried Ciudad Rodrigo. Then the
7th Division, no longer required at the passes, was
withdrawn to the vicinity of the fortress. In a
letter, written from <em>Fuente de Guinaldo on the
27th January 1812</em>, Major Rice says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"We quitted our Alpine abode yesterday, and
have approximated a little to Rodrigo. It was
conjectured that, upon the fall of that place, the
army would make some forward movement&mdash;Salamanca
at least; and some were so sanguine as
to have flattered themselves to have spent the
remainder of the winter at Madrid. Such an
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">événement</i> would be rather agreeable than otherwise,
particularly to me, who am such an admirer
of the Spanish signoras. We heard yesterday of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
the sad reverses of the Spanish patriots under
that obstinate old fool Blake&mdash;complete defeat
and himself taken prisoner. Valencia is also
fallen&mdash;to complete the tale of woe. The taking
of Rodrigo will not compensate for so much
disaster, as it is impossible, unless the Spaniards
gain some ground, that our small aid can be of
ultimate use. Rodrigo is fast being put into a
state of defence. How it is to be garrisoned, or
by what troops, I do not know&mdash;Spaniards, I
presume. Our loss at Rodrigo has been rather
severe, as you will see by the 'Gazette.' Two
generals out of pocket, and poor Craufurd<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> has
died. He was wounded in the vitals, mostly fatal
in such cases. Who would not be a soldier when
so pleasant a fate is in store for him? We are
all now pretty tranquil, and I suppose shall remain
so for a short time&mdash;until Marmont, with his
hordes, gets in motion."</p></div>

<p>Early in February the 51st moved to its old
quarters at Pena Macor, and thence, a little later,
commenced the march towards Badajoz, the reduction
of which fortress Wellington had determined
to attempt at once. The 7th Division was
again detailed for covering duty, and, with the
6th Division, was placed under the command of
General Graham. Crossing the Tagus at Villa
Velha, the two divisions reached Elvaz, and
bivouacked close to Fort La Lippe until the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
arrival of the army destined for the investment
and siege of Badajoz.<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> Then Graham crossed the
Guadiana by the bridge of boats above that place,
and moved into position to the south-east. A
short letter from Major Rice, dated <em>Puebla, two
miles from Zafra, 19th March 1812</em>, describes
what was taking place:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Our lord continues to dash, having undertaken
once more the siege of Badajoz. The better to
insure success and prevent molestation two <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">corps
d'armée</i> have been formed and advanced into
Spain&mdash;Hill on the side of Merida, and Graham
of Balgowan in this direction, for which you must
turn to maps. Our corps is respectable, comprising
three divisions of infantry, two brigades of
cavalry, two troops of horse artillery, with lots of
heavy field-pieces. We crossed the Guadiana on
pontoons on the morning of the 16th, and passed
Valverde and Santa Martha. At the latter place
we had near surprised a body of French, but had
the mortification of seeing them in the distance
retiring in squares, flanked by cavalry. We took
one solitary dragoon. The French evacuated
Zafra last night. We continue to pursue, but
how far I am not in the secret&mdash;various reports,
but only the wigs of course know. We are
greeted in all the towns by acclamations of <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Viva
los Inglezes</i>&mdash;how charming and flattering! We
suffer a few privations; long marches; and in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
evening we generally turn in under the trees
without any other covering than the 'grand
canopy.' I hope we shall do something brilliant.
Prepare yourself to hear of gallant exploits. I
trust the siege of Badajoz will go on well. We,
the 7th Division, luckily for us, were thought too
good for the spade and shovel duty.</p>

<p><em>P.S.</em>&mdash;I have just heard that we shall march
again to-night. I suppose to put a little salt on
Mr Frenchman's tail!"</p></div>

<p>Nothing very brilliant, however, was done by
Graham's corps, although it certainly carried out
its <em>rôle</em>, and prevented any attempt of the enemy
to raise the siege. Nor was this an easy task, for
Graham displayed considerable activity, and endeavoured
to do something more than merely to
hold the French in check. Discovering that a
small body of the enemy was occupying Llerena,
eight leagues distant from his headquarters, the
general ordered the 51st and 100 German riflemen
to make a forced march and surprise the place.
The garrison, however, had received information
of the threatened attack, and evacuated Llerena,
which was immediately occupied by the 51st.
Yet, within a few hours, the regiment learned
that Soult was making a night march on the town
with 5000 men, and the small British force, in its
turn, was obliged to beat a hasty retreat. Graham
waited a day or two, and then determined to turn
the tables on Soult. He issued sudden orders for
his whole corps to march on Llerena and surprise
Soult's force, and the 51st again took part in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
enterprise. Everything went well throughout the
long march, and just before dawn the troops approached
the town. The surprise was thought to
be complete, and success seemed certain, when, of
a sudden, there arose a panic, which had the most
dire consequences. General Graham and his staff
had ridden, unknown to the troops, on ahead of
the columns to reconnoitre, and were fired upon
by a single vedette. They immediately galloped
back to the columns, with the unfortunate result
that they were mistaken for the enemy's cavalry.
Major Rice, writing a week afterwards, thus describes
the affair:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"In one of our night rambles, when the whole
force of our corps, 12,000 in number, was advancing
upon Llerena, the heads of columns were
thrown into confusion by alarm of cavalry. A
firing unfortunately began. Friends, and not
foes, were shot. We<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> expended two officers and
a private. It had like to have proved a business
of the most serious nature. The Hero of Barrosa
rowed us all most terribly for unsteadiness. The
real fact is he himself was in fault, having been in
front with a parcel of A.D.C.'s and staff, and other
tom-fools; not being in their places, and gaping
about, they came suddenly in contact with a
French cavalry picket, upon which D.I.O.<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> was the
word full speed. Our advance gave them a fire
and frightened their animals, who ran furiously
between our columns. We mistook the business
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>for a charge of cavalry, and unfortunately a fire
ensued. Several generals were spilt and run down.
The affair was ludicrous enough. I was at the
head of the column, but escaped by my horse
tumbling head and heels into a ditch&mdash;a species
of good luck, for I was running the gauntlet."</p></div>

<p>All this firing, of course, put an end to surprise,
and by the time that order was restored and the
advance resumed, Soult and his five thousand had
slipped away. After a short stay at Llerena,
Graham moved on to the ground upon which had
been fought the battle of Albuhera; and while
there the troops heard in the distance the desperate
firing which resulted in the capture of Badajoz.</p>

<p>It will be remembered that, twice during the
previous year, the fortress had been besieged and
unsuccessfully assailed. On each of those occasions
Wellington had directed his attack from the
north, intending first to capture the detached
work of St Christoval, in order to establish
batteries there preparatory to an assault on the
castle. For his third attempt he adopted a new
plan, and decided to attack from the south,
capturing the Picurina outwork, breaching the
bastions opposite to it, and then delivering the
assault. The trenches were pushed rapidly forward;
Picurina was carried by assault on the
night of the 25th March, and the breaching
batteries were immediately established. For ten
days they battered the walls of the fortress, until
the necessary breaches were effected, when Wellington
gave immediate orders for the assault to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
take place; and on the night of the 6th-7th
April 1812 occurred one of the most bloody
struggles in the annals of war&mdash;a struggle the
horrors of which lived in the memories of the
surviving assailants for ever afterwards. The
breaches defied all attempts; time after time
assaults were delivered and beaten back; and the
ditch became filled with dead and wounded. Elsewhere,
however, fortune favoured the assailants,
the 3rd Division entering the place by the San
Vincente bastion. Thus Wellington captured his
second fortress in 1812, but at the cost of 5000
men out of the 21,000 engaged.</p>

<p>The scenes which followed the fall of the place
are indescribable; the victorious troops gave
themselves up to plunder and licentiousness of
every description. Drink drove them mad, and
no one could control them. There is no denying
the fact that fearful crimes were committed by the
British soldiers in Badajoz that night, for each
man carried his loaded musket and his bayonet,
and brooked no interference with his revels. Yet
these men were not hardened criminals, for in their
sober moments they would have shuddered at the
very mention of such crimes as, under the influence
of drink, they themselves committed. They
started to enjoy themselves&mdash;to hold high carnival&mdash;but
they were drunk with success at the outset,
and, even before the wine-vaults had been sacked,
the carnival became the wildest and most lawless
ever held. But with this great tragedy scraps of
comedy occasionally mingled, and some of the
scenes would, at any other time, have been con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>sidered
highly entertaining. Dressed as monks
and nuns, or wearing the gay clothes of Spanish
ladies, grizzled and begrimed veterans danced and
sang through the streets; and when eventually
they were driven out of the town, they wended
their way to their bivouacs, wearing these same
garments, and staggering under the weight of
such plunder as they had collected.</p>

<p>Quartermaster Surtees, who had an opportunity
of seeing for himself many of the horrors of this
night and of the next day, tells the hideous tale,
in his 'Twenty-five Years in the Rifle Brigade,'
sufficiently fully to enable one to realise how
utterly demoralised a well-disciplined army can
become almost at a moment's notice. His remarks
on the reason for this are of particular value,
because he had risen from the ranks and was
intimately acquainted with human nature as
represented by the private soldier, and because
he was a man who thought deeply. He concludes
his account of the sacking of Badajoz in the
following words:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"An English army is, perhaps, generally
speaking, under stricter discipline than any other
in the world; but in proportion as they are held
tight while they are in hand, if circumstances
occur to give them liberty I know of no army
more difficult to restrain when once broke loose.
A reason may perhaps be assigned for it in part.
On such occasions as this siege, where they were
long and much exposed to fatigue almost insupportable,
to the most trying scenes of difficulty
and danger, which were generally borne with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
cheerfulness and alacrity, they perhaps reasoned
with themselves and one another in this manner,&mdash;that,
as they had borne so much and so patiently
to get possession of the place, it was but fair that
they should have some indulgence when their
work and trials were crowned with success,
especially as the armies of other powers make it a
rule generally to give an assaulted fortress up to
plunder. They had also become quite reckless of
life from so long exposure to death; but an English
army cannot plunder like the French. The latter
keep themselves more sober and look more to the
solid and substantial benefit to be derived from it,
while the former sacrifice everything to drink, and
when once in a state of intoxication, with all the
bad passions set loose at the same time, I know
not what they will hesitate to perpetrate. The
reader will judge of the state of our soldiers who
had been engaged in the siege when Lord
Wellington found it absolutely necessary to order
in a Portuguese brigade to force the stragglers out
of the town at the point of the bayonet."</p>

<p>Major Rice's next letter was written on the
<em>10th April 1812, from Camp in front of the
Albuhera River, Beresford's position of the late
bloody fight</em>&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Since we crossed the Guadiana on the 16th
March, of which I hastily apprised you, this <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Corps
d'armée</i> has been, I may almost say unceasingly,
in motion, having made nearly the circuit of
Southern Estramadura, the object of which was to
force the French from the towns and positions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
they occupied, and to throw every impediment in
the way of concentration. In our numerous night
marches, with a view to surprise, we have in
general failed, owing to the very superior intelligence
of our active enemy. Some good, however,
may have resulted, though they very speedily
retraced their steps, and yesterday they appeared
in force within a league of this, but I believe
nothing more than a strong reconnaissance of
cavalry. Report now says they are off and our
dragoons advancing, but it is of little consequence,
since they could not relieve Badajoz. This,
I hope, will go by the packet which takes the
intelligence of the capture of Badajoz by assault.
The particulars of the gallant but bloody business
you will have in a better shape than I can give
you. It was the most awful and tremendous
firing I ever heard. We have had the good luck to
escape, though our labour and anxiety for this last
twenty days has been such as to claim attention
as assisting in the glorious cause.</p>

<p>"I have just been reconnoitring the ground of
the battle of Albuhera, and have been conceited
enough to think that even I could have managed
it better. The blundering was great,<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> and terrible
the sacrifice. Boots, caps, jackets, <em>et cetera</em>, are
still kicking about&mdash;in short, it is the richest 'bed
of honour' I have seen for a long while. If the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
French come on we are to act the farce over again
on the same boards. I am scribbling this upon
my knees amidst the greatest confusion of noises
you ever heard&mdash;Babel a joke! Marmont, we
hear, is not idle, and has invested Rodrigo. If so,
we must again trot up to the north. No end to
our labour. I am a good deal done up, but still
hold on. I have not yet been into Badajoz. The
confusion terrible, as you may suppose, after an
assault, and given up to plunder. An order has
this moment arrived to move to our front, I
suppose to give chase. Soult has heard of our
success, and I believe has thought it advisable to
face about."</p></div>

<p>On the 19th April he wrote again, from
Niza:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The morning after I last wrote to you we
broke up from the position of Albuhera and made
an advance movement on Santa Martha. Soult
was within two leagues with 30,000. He made
a little show with cavalry, but thought proper
to retire with his infantry, having heard of the
fall of Badajoz. Had it not fallen it is thought
that a general action must have taken place, which
was to have been tried again upon the same
ground&mdash;but this, I think, I before stated. I, and
we all, thought of a chase; but no, for suddenly
operations were changed. Our lord had heard
that Marmont was playing the devil in the north,
and had pushed to Castello Branco and Villa Velha
to destroy the bridge of boats. The latter was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
not actually done <em>by the enemy</em>, but in the general
panic it was cut adrift, which has occasioned some
trouble in restoring. The plain truth and matter
of fact is that a deep game has been playing, for
had not Badajoz <em>miraculously</em> fallen the siege must
have been raised, we not having force to contend
and resist the two divisions. We are now going
all hands pell-mell north as hard as we can.
Several divisions have crossed the Tagus&mdash;our
turn to-morrow. God knows what is going to be
done, as reports are so various. One thing is
pretty clear: Marmont and his Goths have
behaved with their usual barbarity, having
destroyed and sacked most of the unfortunate
towns which had previously escaped. Never in
this world was so cruel and distressing warfare
waged. It cannot last; the misery is too great to
be endured, and all for what? Our army, pretty
well jaded to death by one thing or other, cannot
stand the incessant fatigue. The sickness is
alarming, and every regiment worked to nothing.
No energy whatever on the part of the Spaniards&mdash;at
least not that I have seen. We shall in a
few days pass the Coa, if Mr Frenchman will
permit. I expect opposition; at all events he will
annoy, and destroy the bridges. When we have
arrived at Rodrigo, Soult will again show himself
before Badajoz and down we shall come again,
and so on until we are done up. You see I am
not more sanguine as to general results than
yourself. I am sorry to see so little hope. You
can form no idea of the scene at Badajoz; no place
was ever so sacked&mdash;and a variety of other things&mdash;<em>nameless</em>!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
The weather is horrible; constantly
wet, and little covering."</p></div>

<p>The somewhat desponding tone of this letter is
perhaps an indication of the writer's weariness of
soul&mdash;a weariness produced by constant marching
about without any apparent prospect of doing any
good. The senior regimental officers, who had the
welfare of their men at heart, and who understood,
from long experience, that the soldiers' powers of
endurance had limits, ever dreaded a breakdown,
and their fears grew greater when they saw their
regiment being harassed for no clear purpose.
This is evident from their letters, as is also the
fact that when once they knew that they were
marching for the definite object of meeting the
enemy and of giving battle, they cast aside their
fears and prepared their men for the coming
struggle. But let us get behind the scenes and
see what was really happening at this particular
time.</p>

<p>After the capture of Badajoz Wellington spent
no time in inaction. General Graham was placed
in command of the fallen fortress, and was given
sufficient men to repair its defences and prevent
its recapture by the enemy; while the bulk of the
army marched away. Soult, who had been
hastening from the south to the relief of the
French garrison, and who had been held in check
by the covering troops, on hearing that all was
over, turned about and withdrew towards Seville.
Marmont, however, had succeeded, while the siege
was in progress, in invading Portugal and pene<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>trating
to Castello Branco. Wellington now
advanced against him; but the French general,
forbidden by Napoleon to attempt to form a
junction with Soult, saw that little was to be
gained by advancing farther. His first impulse
was to fight, but he remembered that the rivers in
his rear were in flood and would impede his
withdrawal in the event of defeat, so he deemed
it more prudent to retire behind the line of the
Agueda river, and there await developments.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Wellington was straining every
nerve to meet the heavy combinations which the
French were bringing against him. King Joseph,
in supreme command of the French in the
Peninsula, was in occupation of Madrid, and
thence issued orders to his subordinate generals,
who, however, lacked confidence in the military
plans of their chief&mdash;a fact which proved of the
greatest advantage to Wellington. United action
on the part of the French generals would have
placed the Allies in a grave situation; but
fortunately the three French armies were at this
time widely separated, and Wellington contrived
so to deceive his adversaries that they were quite
unable to say against which force he intended to
operate. Soult in Andalusia felt certain that the
Allies would invade that province; King Joseph
imagined that the Spanish capital would be the
immediate objective; while Marmont, away to the
north, had every reason to believe that Wellington
was bringing all his strength against him. As a
matter of fact, the original intention of the British
commander had been to carry the war into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
Andalusia, but, abandoning the idea (for political
and military reasons), he determined to attack
Marmont. Yet, by means of false reports and
ostentatious movements, he contrived to continue
to deceive Soult as to his real plans.</p>

<p>Before following Marmont, however, Wellington
deemed it necessary to prevent Soult and the
army of Andalusia from reinforcing him. Soult,
south of the Tagus, would have to cross that river
before marching to the assistance of Marmont;
his pontoon trains had been captured in Badajoz,
and the only means of crossing the river was by
the bridge of boats which Marmont had constructed
at Almaraz. The importance of this
crossing was well known to the French, who had
consequently thrown up three strong forts and
a bridge-head to protect it; but the destruction
of Almaraz, with its bridge and its stores, was
essential to Wellington's plans, and, though
doubtful of the possibility of its being carried
out, he ordered General Hill to make the attempt.
As events turned out, the surprise of Almaraz
was one of the boldest enterprises of the war,
and by the 18th May Hill had done all that was
required of him. But until the work had been
completed, whither Hill had taken his force and
for what purpose were things known only to
Wellington, who had halted the remainder of his
army to await news of the result of Hill's mission.</p>

<p>Writing from <em>Castello Branco, 22nd May 1812</em>,
Major Rice describes what was going on&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p><div class="blockquot">

<p>"Hill's corps has marched upon Almaraz, to
destroy the bridge across the Tagus. The object,
it may be conjectured, is to prevent Marmont or
anybody else crossing. I venture not to speculate
further. What our lord is about I know not.
Guinaldo is his headquarters. I suppose he is
planning something great and glorious. Touching
ourselves&mdash;the 7th Division&mdash;no talk of
moves; an unusually long respite from toil, and
much in favour of boots, shoes, and horseflesh.
Our assizes have been going on since our arrival,
and likely to continue. Much business on hand.
I am on the jury. We generally hang or shoot
half a dozen fellows, notwithstanding every soldier
is a gentleman and a man of honour, and receives
votes of thanks from both Houses of Parliament,
which he does not value so much as a pot of
Whitbread's Entire."</p></div>

<p>From the latter part of this letter it is evident
that Wellington had taken the opportunity of
some leisure time to overhaul the discipline of
his army, and his methods were drastic in the
extreme. Even before he had witnessed the outrages
committed by his men at Ciudad Rodrigo
and Badajoz, he had been appalled by the indiscipline
of his troops in disregarding orders
concerning marauding. The British army was
operating in a friendly country, and it was therefore
all the more important that the inhabitants
and their property should be treated with due
respect. The French, on the other hand, were
at war with Spain, and if, therefore, they pillaged
and laid waste as they went along, it was per<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>haps
no more than the inhabitants expected,
though it is only fair to the French generals
to state that, as a rule, they did all in their
power to suppress marauding and pillage. It
must be admitted that it was most difficult to
impress upon the British soldiers, marching on
the heels of the French through a country already
pillaged, that it was a sin to take the goods of
the people, and doubtless at an early stage of
the war the men got into the habit of taking
from the inhabitants of the villages any food or
provisions of which they were in want. As time
passed matters went from bad to worse, and the
men did not stop at food, but began to plunder
the inhabitants of their money and valuables.
Wine-cellars were discovered and entered, with
the result that drunkenness and outrages of every
description became common. Wellington, alive
to the gravity of the situation, issued stringent
orders which, had they been carried out, would
have put an end to these evils; but there were
no means of carrying them out, and all this he
represented from time to time to the home authorities.
He pointed out that under existing
circumstances it was impossible to bring home to
the offenders the offences which they had committed,
and he recommended wider powers to
courts-martial and the formation of military
police. He did not complain of the discipline
of regiments as a whole, but he wrote in the
strongest terms about the absence of discipline
to be found in detachments, which, of necessity,
were always out in various parts of the country;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
and he drew particular attention to the number
of malingerers who filled the hospitals principally
for the purpose of plundering when on the march.
"The disorders which these soldiers have," wrote
Wellington to Lord Liverpool, "are of a very
trifling description; they are considered to render
them incapable of serving with their regiments;
but they certainly do not incapacitate them from
committing outrages of all descriptions on their
passage through the country, and in the last
movements of the hospitals, the soldiers have
not only plundered the inhabitants of their property,
but the hospital stores which moved with
the hospitals, and have sold the plunder. And
all these outrages are committed with impunity;
no proof can be brought, on oath, before a court-martial
that any individual has committed an
outrage, and the soldiers of the army are becoming
little better than a band of robbers."</p>

<p>On the top of all this came the wild orgies
which accompanied the sacking of Badajoz; and
Wellington determined to adopt the strongest
measures in order to restore the discipline of his
army. We may say here, and without in any
way belittling the military genius of England's
greatest soldier, that Wellington knew nothing
of the finer processes of producing and maintaining
discipline among British soldiers. He
was not of the school of Sir John Moore. He
had no sympathy with the soldier, or indeed
with the officer. He spoke of the men who won
his victories for him as the scum of the earth
and as the sweepings of the jails, and he treated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
them always with coldness, amounting almost to
contempt. Probably he was the hardest master
under whom men ever served, for at all times
he governed by the lash, and he never hesitated
to shoot or hang an unfortunate soldier, if he
deemed it necessary to make an example. That
these executions were not sometimes necessary
we do not pretend to say, but the method of
carrying them out, in the face of the whole army,
served only to brutalise it. Officers and men
became callous even of the capital punishment,
and judging by the letter quoted above, Major
Rice thought little of condemning to death half
a dozen men for possibly trivial offences. Several
of Wellington's generals, taking their cue from
their chief, flogged and hanged freely, with the
result that there was no love lost between them
and their men; but, like the dog who licks the
hand that beat him, these soldiers would follow
their commanders without questioning, and perform
for them prodigious acts of valour. Few of
the Peninsular generals were really popular with
their men, but Graham and Hill were exceptions.
The latter, though a brilliant leader, was always
sympathetic, and endeared himself to all ranks,
who spoke of him among themselves as "Daddy
Hill," though he was barely old enough to have
been the father of any of them.</p>

<p>The feelings which the soldiers had towards
Wellington ("Old Douro," as they called him)
are well described by an officer of the 51st:<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a>&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Where is the British soldier who ever saw
him on the field of battle that felt not within
himself, though ten times his number stood in his
front opposed to him, that that field must be one
of victory? Wherever he was, with his calm
countenance, on those occasions always with a
smile upon it, the soldiers would say, 'Ay, there
he goes, boys. All's right.' And forward they
rushed, careless of danger or numbers, and thus
driving the French out of the strongest and most
impregnable positions&mdash;such was their confidence
in his talents and good fortune. And these were
not the sentiments of the private soldier alone,
but the deep-rooted feeling of every individual in
that army. We followed, we fought for him, but
though he won our confidence, he never gained
our love."</p></div>

<p>These words were written after the Peninsular
War and after Waterloo, and scores of Wellington's
officers wrote of their chief in a similar
strain. But in earlier Peninsular days, before
the regimental officers and the men had discovered
their commander's greatness, they had no great
confidence in him, and they were wont to grumble
at his orders and to criticise his actions. Many of
his earlier subordinate generals, although quite
ignorant of war, saw something wrong in everything
that Wellington did, and their removal
to a less active sphere in England gave these
detractors the opportunity of spreading calumnies
about the only capable head which the army then
possessed. Wellington, however, survived all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
this and much more, and as the war went on, the
voice of the army changed, until, in the end, there
were few officers conceited enough to venture to
doubt the wisdom of his plans, and few of the
rank and file who had not absolute faith in everything
that he did. He established among both
officers and men a reputation for infallibility, and
he convinced them of his instinctive genius for
war. That he lacked the ability to gain their
affections was nothing to them, and it is certain
that, in spite of those who maintain that popularity
with the troops is essential to military genius, if
any of his Peninsular or Waterloo veterans were
alive to-day, they would still hold Wellington to
be the greatest of British generals, even though
they might admit that he was a hard master, and
one who never forgot and seldom forgave.</p>

<p>Long after he had fought his last battle&mdash;even
to the end of his days, Wellington upheld his
harsh code of punishment, and he resisted strenuously,
with all the weight of his opinion, every
attempt to diminish flogging in the army in times
of peace. Not until twelve years after his death
was this put an end to, and not until 1882 was
flogging on active service finally swept away by
the Army Discipline Act. Old and tried officers
held views similar to those of the great Duke,&mdash;by
the lash alone could the discipline of the army be
maintained; and no greater supporter of corporal
punishment can be found than that high-minded
leader of men, Sir William Napier, the historian
of the Peninsular War. He was a man acknowledged
to have been beloved&mdash;even worshipped by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
all ranks, as the epitome of all that was just and
sympathetic, a man who wrote of British soldiers,
as a class, as the most noble of men; yet, in 1846,
he put all his vast powers of reasoning into a letter
to 'The Times', in order to inveigh against what
he considered the sentimental spirit of modern
times which desired the abolition, or reduction, of
flogging in the army. He firmly believed in the
lash for certain offences as a deterrent of crime,
and no one knew and understood the British
soldier of his time better than did Sir William
Napier. We can only conclude, therefore, that
the times have changed, and the men with them;
for thirty years' immunity from the lash has
resulted in no harm to the British army.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">CHAPTER X.</a><br />
<span class="center xs">SALAMANCA AND MADRID.</span></h2>

<p class="noindent">In June 1812 Wellington was ready to attack
Marmont, whose army he had now succeeded in
isolating. By destroying the bridge at Almaraz
the commander-in-chief had made it practically
impossible for Drouet and Soult to reinforce
Marmont; King Joseph's army was out of hand,
and not likely to take the field; and the only
other French army of any importance was kept
busy in the neighbourhood of Corunna, where
small bodies of British troops were landed from
time to time to harass the Frenchmen. Marmont
was at this time near Salamanca, where he had
strong fortifications, and it was known that he
intended to hold first the line of the Tormes
river, and then, if forced to retire, the line of the
Douro.</p>

<p>On the 13th June, Wellington's army, consisting
of nearly forty thousand British and Portuguese
troops, advanced to the Tormes, and on the 17th
was in front of Salamanca, from which the French
withdrew without offering battle, though they
left some eight hundred men in occupation of the
forts. Major Rice wrote, on the 18th June, from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
<em>Camp, left bank of the Tormes, half a mile from
Salamanca&mdash;</em></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"My latest from the Azava will have told you
of our forward movement. We arrived before
Salamanca on the 16th with little opposition;
skirmishing, principally with cavalry; their
advance posts all driven in. The military <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup
d'œil</i> was fine, as the whole operations and effect
could at once be seen. Marmont made some show
of defence in the evening, but thought it prudent
in the night to retire with his principal force. He
has, however, left two works in the town garrisoned,
which defend the passage of the bridge, and which
cause, therefore, a temporary inconvenience, as all
supplies for the army have to be carried round by
the ford. One division of the army is in the town,
and notwithstanding all the firing that is going
on, the shops are open, and every one walking
about as in times of the most profound tranquillity.
The apathy of these people is beyond description;
death or danger seems not to cause a sensation.
What is extraordinary enough is that to-night
there is to be a ball given by General Graham.
They will dance to the sound of the cannon. We
are now constructing batteries; by to-morrow
morning we hope they will be pounded out of
their dens. Salamanca has been a fine town, the
public buildings beautiful in the extreme, but most
miserably dilapidated by the soft and gentle hand
of war. I am just going to take a review of the
ladies; yesterday they did not show. The cannon
is roaring most tremendously. Our labours and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
fatigues have been very great; march always at
one o'clock; now are continually on the alert,
men remaining accoutred day and night. The
enemy have fallen back upon Toro; whether we
follow, or they retrograde, at present <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">je n'en sais
rien</i>.</p>

<p>"You talk of Philippon and his defence. The
fellow showed genius in his mode of defence; but
I cannot say much for his defenders; nothing that
skill could devise was left untried; the place<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> was
taken at last at the strongest point&mdash;so much
for what I have said. We have been enjoying
the 'canopy' since quitting our cantonments; the
weather is scorching by day, and cold by night&mdash;pleasing
variations. I still hold out. The Tormes
is in winter a river of military importance, being
extremely rapid. It has apparently a magnificent
bridge of thirty arches. I am just going reconnoitring,
but it will be a reconnaissance confined
solely to the sweet signoras."</p></div>

<p>But the Frenchmen were not "pounded out of
their dens" as quickly as the Major had hoped,
for the forts held out for another week or more,
during which time Marmont made every endeavour
to drive the British away and relieve the garrisons.
The 51st were engaged almost daily in assisting to
frustrate Marmont's designs, though they came in
for no serious fighting until the 22nd. On that
morning the regiment came off twenty-four hours'
outpost duty, but no sooner was the brigade
bivouac reached than an order was received to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
advance. Moving forward for about a mile, the
brigade deployed into line, and then continued the
advance up the slope of a hill, beyond the crest of
which nothing could be seen. That the enemy
was at hand, however, was soon made evident, as
musket shots were heard, and a few stray bullets
passed over the men's heads. Presently balls came
over the hill in showers, and some, grazing the hill
slope, began to make havoc in the ranks. But the
51st and 68th, now aware that the enemy was
within measurable distance, moved steadily forward,
unable to fire since no mark was visible, and intent
only on closing with the foe. At length the hill
was surmounted, when, not ten yards away, the
assailants saw the line of Frenchmen, and, with a
wild cheer, dashed in. Yet they were too late; the
enemy's advanced post had played its part, and,
breaking, the men who composed it fled to the
village, about one hundred yards away, where a
large force, lying concealed, immediately opened
fire and checked the British advance. The gallant
brigade had carried out its orders and cleared the
hill, so falling back a few yards it sheltered itself
behind the crest, until the enemy's fire slackened
and then ceased. It had been a brisk skirmish, and
the 51st had suffered a good deal as they advanced
up the hill, Captain Smellie and some twenty men
having been wounded, and two or three men killed.
A week afterwards, Major Rice, in a short note,
dated <em>Between Toro and Salamanca, 30th June
1812</em>, described the affair&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p><div class="blockquot">

<p>"The gallant 7th Division forced a post, left of
the enemy. Wellington, our lord, was pleased to
say that we run into them handsomely. The
burst was sharp&mdash;the hottest I have ever experienced;
we lost two or three and twenty. I
escaped with only the loss of my favourite horse,
which was shot under me. Marmont is expected
to defend the passage of the Douro. We are
dreadfully harassed; have not been under cover
for a month. Much haste."</p></div>

<p>John Green,<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> who, as a private of the 68th, was
present on this occasion, refers to the fight in the
following words: "The 51st Regiment suffered
considerably, having several killed and wounded.
Major Rice's horse was shot from under him. Some
men belonging to the Chasseurs Britanniques
skinned the horse, and sold the flesh to their own
men and to the Portuguese at three <em>vints</em>, or four-pence
halfpenny per lb."</p>

<p>Major Rice had been unfortunate in his horses.
One, it will be remembered, broke away and
deserted to the enemy at Badajoz. The second
was fated to be eaten by the allied troops. Probably
the owner considered the end of his second
horse no more dreadful than that of the first; and
it is to be hoped that Government compensated
him for the loss of his two chargers, though it is
not probable that any such generosity was shown
to the British officer, who, at that time, was even
required to provide at his own expense beasts of
burden to carry his baggage in the field.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>
<p>Five days after these events the Salamanca forts
fell, and Marmont beat a retreat towards Valladolid.
Wellington followed leisurely, keeping
touch with the enemy's rearguard, and engaging
it slightly at the bridge of Tordesillas on the 2nd
July. But neither side yet felt inclined to give
battle; and the British were by no means hopeful
that their labours were going to be rewarded with
a fight. Major Rice certainly took a gloomy view
of the future when he wrote, on the 6th July,
from <em>Camp near Medina del Campo</em>&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Our lord, I am just told, is making up his
dispatches, and we scrubs are graciously permitted
to avail ourselves of the opportunity. Since I
last communicated, nothing of importance has
transpired. The army appears to have come to
a <em>check</em>&mdash;rather, I think, than a <em>fault</em>. Marmont
has earthed himself safe on the left bank of the
Douro, and secured the bridge in front of Tordesillas.
The fords are not good and are always
precarious, but about these I know nothing, so I
ought not to presume to give an opinion as to
what is intended, or what can be done with safety
to the army. His lordship only can know, as he
must necessarily possess the best information as to
the strength and resources of the enemy. For my
part, I am not a bit more sanguine in this glorious
cause than ever, and though we have dashed a
few leagues in this patriotic ground among the
<em>vivas</em> of the mob, <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'mauœuvring'">manœuvring</ins> seems to be the
game that both parties are inclined to, and, if I
may judge, both are equally shy as to general<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
action. We have been wretchedly off for this
some time; scanty fare, bad biscuit, &amp;c. The
weather dreadfully hot by day and cold by night&mdash;beyond
what I ever experienced. We are lying
in cornfields without the smallest covering. How
the men stand this severe work is to me astonishing.
A few days must soon bring to light our
lord's gigantic plan for annihilating the foe. If
we take water or form bridge, it will be a second
Lodi. My brains are baking into a paste. It is
just rumoured that the brutes won't fight; if so,
the game must be up in this favourite peninsula."</p></div>

<p>Marmont was now reinforced by Bonet's division,
and, with this addition to his strength, the French
general was able to turn on Wellington and force
him to retire. Though at times Marmont pressed
his adversary hard, day succeeded day without
any decided advantage being gained by either
side. Throughout the 19th, 20th, and 21st July,
the hostile armies manœuvred in presence of each
other, at the end of which time both armies had
passed to the left bank of the Tormes river. On
the 22nd, Marmont, by rapidly extending his left,
attempted to cut Wellington's communications
with Portugal, but the wide extension proved his
ruin, for the British commander saw the opportunity
for which he had been waiting so long, and
immediately seized it. He hurled one division
against the French left with such vigour as to roll
it back in complete disorder, and, simultaneously,
with two other divisions he assailed the centre with
like results. Then bethinking himself of making<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
victory doubly sure, he despatched the Light
Division post-haste to the Huerta ford, in the
hope of barring the passage of the Tormes to the
disorganised masses of the enemy. This movement,
however, failed, as the French crossed higher
up stream, and made good their escape towards
the Douro.</p>

<p>Such, briefly, was the battle of Salamanca, in
which Marmont was severely wounded and twelve
thousand Frenchmen placed <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">hors de combat</i>, while
the Allies suffered a lost of six thousand.</p>

<p>The pursuit was taken up at once, and Clausel,
who had succeeded Marmont in command of the
French army, collected his forces and withdrew
rapidly to Valladolid, which place, however, he was
obliged to evacuate on Wellington's arrival near
the town on the 30th July. Deciding to profit to
the full by his almost unexpected success, the
latter then turned south and marched straight for
the Spanish capital. King Joseph fled, and on
the 12th August the victorious Allies entered
Madrid amidst the acclamations of the populace.</p>

<p>Major Rice found no time to write of these
events, but one of the subalterns of the 51st thus
describes the entry into Madrid: "The next day,
the 12th August, the anniversary of the Prince
Regent's birthday, we entered the capital of Spain,
and never in my life did I witness such a scene.
No quiet John Bull can conceive the enthusiasm
the people of Madrid displayed on that day. If
we had been angels instead of men, we could not
have been better received. Our division was the
first British one that entered, and our regiment,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
being the head of the column, had the good fortune
to lead. The crowds gathered round us so quickly
that we could scarce move on; they seemed
frantic with joy; every balcony, every window
was filled with beautiful women, who showered
down flowers upon our heads as we passed, and
the air was rent with acclamations of 'Long live the
brave scarlet fellows (colorados), our deliverers!'
'George for ever!' 'Wellington, the brave Wellington,
for ever!' But when Wellington himself
came, no language can describe their feelings or enthusiasm.
They fell on their knees to kiss the ground
his horse's hoofs had pressed, and they deemed
themselves fortunate if they could only touch his
clothes. Never shall I forget our entrance."</p>

<p>The French still held the Retiro, a fortified
post in the centre of the city, and on the
following evening, while the officers of the 51st
were preparing to go to a ball given by the citizens
to Wellington and his officers, orders were received
for the regiment and the 68th to invest the place
forthwith. Some few shots were exchanged with
the French sentries that night, but a cordon was
drawn rapidly round the Retiro, and next morning,
when the fort was on the point of being stormed,
the garrison surrendered&mdash;amongst the captures on
this occasion being, strange to relate, the eagle of
the 51st French Regiment, which, with others,
was sent to England and eventually deposited in
Chelsea Hospital. And there were some of the
British 51st who regarded this eagle in the light
of a phœnix rising from the ashes of the colours
burned on the eve of the battle of Fuentes d'Onor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></p>

<p>Madrid now gave itself up to gaiety&mdash;balls,
bull-fights, illuminations, and fêtes of every description,
and a week later the 51st marched to
the Escorial, where it was quartered until the 1st
September. On that day Wellington, leaving two
divisions under General Hill at Madrid, took the
remainder of his army with him and marched
north, for the purpose of driving back the enemy
from the Douro to Burgos. "Our march," says
Ensign Mainwaring of the 51st, "though rapid,
was by no means disagreeable; for traversing a
rich wine-country, our route lay through vast
plains covered with vineyards, and at this season,
autumn, just before the vintage, the vines were
laden with clusters of ripe grapes, tempting to the
appetite and beautiful to the eye. In this manner
we travelled on, without anything occurring
worthy of note till we came within sight of the
castle of Burgos, and we began to anticipate, not
with much pleasure, all the inglorious toils and
arduous and fatiguing business of a siege&mdash;the
most disagreeable military duty a soldier has on
service, digging and delving in dust and dirt like
ploughmen, to shelter ourselves, ere morning's
dawn, from shot and shell whizzing about our ears
at each moment, killing or mutilating our next
neighbour. No excitement, as in a general action,
by the immediate prospect of getting at the foe,
your only hope that you may get through your
twenty-four hours in the trenches unscathed, back
to your bivouac, to eat, drink, and sleep till your
turn in the batteries comes round again, varied by
the storm of an outwork or a sortie of the enemy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
to either of which occurrences the soldier looks
forward as something to enliven and break in upon
the routine of his daily labours."</p>

<p>Clausel had withdrawn slowly from the Douro
as Wellington advanced, and on the 18th September
passed through Burgos, leaving a garrison of
eighteen hundred men in the castle. To invest
and reduce this Wellington set to work immediately,
twelve thousand men being detailed for
the siege and twenty thousand for the covering
force. So strong, however, was the castle, and so
determined the garrison, that after an investment
of thirty-three days, during which time five
separate assaults were delivered and repulsed, and
several desperate sallies of the garrison were met
and beaten back, Wellington was obliged to abandon
the enterprise and raise the siege, when he
learned, in the middle of October, that Clausel,
having received a reinforcement of twelve thousand
fresh troops from France, was marching down upon
him with some forty-four thousand men. During
these operations the 51st, with the remainder of
the 7th Division, formed part of the covering
army, watching the country between Burgos and
Vittoria, and spending some days near the village
of Monasterio, but never called upon to do more
than check reconnaissances pushed out by the
enemy.</p>

<p>On the 21st October began the memorable retreat
from Burgos&mdash;a retreat which proved almost as
arduous as that to Corunna, nearly four years
before. The weather was generally severe, and
the enemy pressed the pursuit vigorously, ever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
engaging the cavalry of the rearguard and sometimes
making captures. The rivers were in flood
and seldom passable save at the bridges, facts which
gave the advantage to Wellington, whose engineers,
<ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'now adepts'">now adept</ins> at mines and explosions, blew up
each bridge as it was crossed, and thus from time
to time checked the French onslaught. In this
way, by the 26th October, Wellington was behind
the Pisuerga river, with the mined bridge at Cabezon
between him and the enemy, and thence he
despatched parties to secure the bridges in his
rear&mdash;viz., at Tudela and Tordesillas on the Douro,
and at Valladolid and Simancas on the Pisuerga.
The 7th Division was employed in holding the
three last-named bridges, the 51st being responsible
for that at Valladolid. The French came on
swiftly, and leaving a division in front of Wellington's
main body, threw out their right and swept
down on the post held by the 51st. Opening
from the high ground on the opposite bank with
cannon and musketry, the enemy soon rendered
the bridge untenable; but the company of the 51st
defending it, even after the lieutenant in command
had been borne to the rear with his right arm
shattered, gallantly held on until the mine was
ready. Then, having lost three men killed and
fourteen wounded, the company withdrew rapidly
as the bridge was blown up. The bridge at
Simancas, being similarly menaced, was also destroyed,
as was that at Tordesillas, on the 28th,
by a party of the Brunswick Oels Corps detached
for the purpose. But the destruction of the latter
bridge was of little avail, for it was followed by an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
act of daring gallantry on the part of the French,
perhaps without parallel in the history of war.
Riding up to the broken bridge, the Frenchmen,
annoyed at finding it impassable, hesitated for
a moment, but then, dismounting, they set to
work to form a small raft, upon which they
placed their arms and clothes. Napier tells the
story of what followed, and it is worth repeating.
"Sixty officers and non-commissioned
officers," he says, "then plunged into the water
with their swords between their teeth, swimming,
and pushing the raft before them. Under the
protection of a cannonade they thus crossed this
great river, though it was in full and strong water
and the weather very cold, and having reached
the other side, naked as they were, stormed the
tower, whereupon the Brunswickers, amazed at
the action, abandoned their ground, leaving the
gallant Frenchmen masters of the passage."</p>

<p>The French restored the bridge as quickly as
possible, but in the meanwhile Wellington had
withdrawn to the left bank of the Douro by the
Tudela bridge and by the Puente de Douro, and
on the 30th October he marched towards Tordesillas
in such strength as to prevent the enemy
making use of the bridge which they had so nobly
won. On this very spot Major Rice wrote his last
letter of the year:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<br />
<p class="xs right smcap">"Camp before the Bridge of Tordesillas,</p>
<p class="xs right padr2 smcap">left bank of the Douro,</p>
<p class="xs right padr4"><em>5th November 1812</em>.</p>

<p>"You will not fail to perceive, as per date, that
our movements of late have been retrograde&mdash;I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
won't call it in this place <em>retreating</em>, because it is
possibly only a little run on the part of our Most
Noble and Gallant Marquis, whose judgment and
military abilities are inferior <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">nulli</i>&mdash;not even Bony
the Great. You will, however, see all in public
print, and then you may call it what you like, and
I think we shall be perfectly <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">d'accord</i>. My last
short and hasty, though brilliant, display of matter
was from Monasterio. The following day we were
pushed in very gallantly (by <em>superior force</em> understood);
our loss not great, and we committed some
havoc among the legions&mdash;hats and wigs cheap
enough. The great superiority of the enemy in
all the arms of war, I suppose, upon <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'reconnaisance'">reconnaissance</ins>,
decided his lordship on raising the siege of Burgos
and falling back. The fact of the matter is, we
were doing too much for our means, and, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">entre nous</i>,
are lucky in getting clear off. Our movements
have been rapid, and not a little pressed; fine
destruction of bridges, &amp;c.; in fact, all the agreeables
attending retrograde movements, or, as Soult
calls them, <em>to the flank</em>.</p>

<p>"Our division defended the front of Valladolid,
to retard the enemy. Our regiment lost a few
men; a poor woman, singularly enough, was killed
by the first cannon ball fired, and an officer minus
an arm. Two officers of ours have also died this
week. Our sufferings have not been a little; the
weather horridly cold and wet; not once under
cover for these last two months. The poor soldiers
dreadfully off; but I must not depict all the
miseries; the truth must not be told at all times.
And why tell you, or talk on subjects which you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
cannot understand? I often think how ridiculous
one of my compositions would appear in print,
under the head of 'Intercepted Correspondence
from Spain!'</p>

<p>"The whole army is now encamped in an immense
vineyard&mdash;as far as the eye can reach, and the
river between us and Mr Frenchman. Our people
chat across, while going for water or washing.
War is a strange business, and I am most heartily
tired of the novelty. Hill's army has quitted the
Tagus, and is moving upon us. The game, I think,
is pretty well up. It is labour in vain, while poor
John Bull only suffers and bleeds, as you will see
by those who caught the bubble against the walls
of Burgos. How lucky we are to get out of the
digging business! So excellent a corps must
always be in front, for the general safety of the
whole. The unfortunate country people are being
driven to desperation; what between friend and
foe, their situation is deplorable; everything is
taken from them, either by force or on requisition.
The scenes of warfare are too shocking to witness.
Sick and wounded men, in want of every comfort,
add to the horrors which words cannot describe.
But one must not reflect. Some French wag wrote
up upon a wall: <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">un bon soldat faut avoir la force
d'un cheval, le cœur d'un lion, l'appétit d'un souris,
l'humanité d'un bête</i>&mdash;a true bill enough, and expressive
of the Peninsular and Favourite War.
The army must have repose; it is naked, jaded,
and done up. If the lord gets hold of this, I shall
certainly be hanged. You shall hear soon of
further operations and all agreeables."</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>

<p>Officers writing from the seat of war seldom told
the whole bare tale; possibly they had the feeling
that their letters were overhauled in transit, or
they may have been disinclined to mention incidents
which their friends at home, knowing nothing of
war or of human weakness under trying circumstances,
would regard as outrages. But these
things left unsaid came out afterwards, and what
Major Rice thought that his brother (to whom the
above letter was written) would not understand
was the extraordinary incident which took place
at the very commencement of the retreat from
Burgos. Arriving late in camp, after a heavy day
of marching, near the town of Duenas, between
Burgos and Valladolid, the men heard that the
wine-vaults were full of the recent vintage, and
with one accord they broke loose and sacked the
vaults. "Some of them were found dead, literally
drowned in wine, it having overflowed in the
cellars and suffocated the poor wretches who were
too drunk to escape. Next morning, at daybreak,
when we stood to our arms to recommence the
march, the scene was one, perhaps, without parallel
in the annals of military history; for I scarcely
exaggerate when I say that, with the exception of
the officers, the whole army was drunk." Thus
wrote Ensign Mainwaring of the 51st, and Napier
bears him out in saying that at one time "twelve
thousand men were in a state of helpless inebriety."
Fortunately the rearguard was well away from the
neighbourhood of the wine, though, as the historian
points out, there was at the moment little to fear
from the enemy, "since the French drunkards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
were even more numerous <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'that those'">than those</ins> of the British
army." Small wonder that the major thought
that his civilian brother would not understand
such things. He himself realised, as probably did
Wellington also, that fatigue had produced so
great a craving for drink as to drive the men mad.
To punish twelve thousand men equally implicated
was, of course, out of the question, and fortunately
there was no further opportunity of obtaining
drink during the retreat. The incident, however,
showed the temper of the troops, and, though many
bore their hardships with extraordinary fortitude,
and though all fought valiantly when called upon
to do so, there is no disguising the fact that the
discipline of the army as a whole was bad.</p>

<p>The woman who, Major Rice says, was killed by
the first shot at the Valladolid bridge, was the
wife of a soldier of the regiment, and at the
moment when the unfortunate shot struck her she
was sitting by the side of her husband, eating her
breakfast in fancied shelter. One wonders what
the women of those days were made of, for numbers
of them accompanied the army throughout the
Peninsular War, and shared all the trials and
troubles of their husbands. Numerous are the
stories told of the heroism of these women, but
why they were permitted to take the field is never
made clear. With every regiment there marched
several of them; children were born to them on
the line of march; they died of fatigue; they saw
their husbands killed in action, and sometimes
they married again, while still on active service.
Green, in his 'Vicissitudes,' mentions the case of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
regimental woman (of the 68th) who married no
fewer than four husbands during the war, each one
dying or being killed almost before her eyes. One
marvels at the indomitable courage possessed by
these women of a century ago; and there were
officers' wives who at times were present with the
army, one notable case being that of Mrs Dalbiac,
who, throughout the battle of Salamanca, seated
on her horse, and often exposed to the enemy's
fire, calmly watched her husband's performances
in the fight. Nor was this courage restricted to
British women, for every one knows the romantic
story of the young Spanish lady who became the
wife of Major (afterwards Sir Harry) Smith, after
Badajoz, and thenceforward followed the fortunes
of her husband in bivouac and camp until the end
of the war.<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a></p>

<p>The army remained in the Tordesillas camp only
a day after Major Rice despatched the above letter,
when it marched to Salamanca, and there, on
the 10th November, it was joined by Hill's force
from Madrid. It will be remembered that when
Wellington marched north on the 1st September,
he left two divisions (under Hill) in occupation of
the Spanish capital. After a while the armies of
Soult and King Joseph began to display considerable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
activity, and towards the end of October were
reported to be marching on Madrid in overwhelming
strength. Whether Hill could have held his
own is doubtful; perhaps, fortunately, he was not
required to make the attempt, even if he had any
intention of doing so, for Wellington, so soon as
he had decided on withdrawing from before Burgos,
ordered Hill to abandon Madrid and join him, if
possible, by way of the Guadarama Pass. On the
last day of October, therefore, Hill, having blown
up the Retiro and destroyed the stores in Madrid,
retreated by the Guadarama, and was never
seriously pressed by the French.</p>

<p>The united army then marched out of Salamanca
on the way to Ciudad Rodrigo, and during the
following week the rearguard was almost continuously
at bay. The main body plodded on, generally
in pelting rain, always on muddy roads, short of
food, and otherwise distressed beyond measure.
As on the retreat to Corunna, the soldiers grew
sullen for want of a battle, and at length the
sight of vast herds of swine in the forests proved
too much for them. They wanted food, and here
it was at hand; so they quitted the ranks by
hundreds to shoot the pigs, until Wellington,
hearing the heavy firing, thought that the enemy
was pushing an attack. For a time the army was
at the mercy of the French, had they but known
it; but order was presently restored, though not
before two of the marauders had been hanged, by
Wellington's command, as an example to the rest,
and not before two thousand British stragglers
had been captured by the enemy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span></p>

<p>At San Muños the 51st came in for a sharp
skirmish, and had Captain McCabe killed and
eight men wounded; at the passage of the Huebra,
the Light Division, covering the rear, had some
heavy fighting, for the enemy's pursuit was vigorous,
and his artillery fire often heavy. Stragglers
were cut off, and a good deal of baggage was
captured, but at length the troops saw the friendly
walls of Ciudad Rodrigo, and knew that their
troubles were at an end. The retreat had lasted
for nearly a month; the weather throughout was
inclement; the sick and wounded suffered severely;
the whole army was hungry as well as footsore;
and consequently the bulk of the men were out of
hand, and even insubordinate. The pig-raiding
prevailed up to the last day's march, for no punishment
could stop it; and had the retreat continued
a little longer, Wellington's army must have
suffered some terrible disaster.</p>

<p>Once back on their old ground, and supplied
with ample provisions from Rodrigo, the men's
spirits were restored, and getting into dry quarters
in the villages surrounding the fortress, the soldiers
settled down for the winter, and put the weary
retreat out of their minds. They were worn out;
for almost a year they had marched continuously,
and fought frequently; they had placed to their
credit the capture of Ciudad Rodrigo and Badajoz,
the victory at Salamanca, the triumphant entry
into Madrid, and numerous minor successes. Only
the retreat from Burgos tarnished their laurels;
for when their losses, during this last phase of the
year's operations, came to be reckoned up, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
were found to be heavy. Including the siege of
Burgos, Wellington's army suffered to the extent
of some nine thousand men, not counting a vast
number of officers and soldiers subsequently
invalided from the effects of the unfortunate
retreat.</p>

<p>Major Rice, probably to his own astonishment,
succeeded in struggling on to the end of the year's
campaigning, and then, having seen his regiment
settled in tolerable comfort in cantonments, was
forced to give in. He was immediately invalided
home, and his brother, who had received his
Tordesillas letter only on the 26th December, was
no little surprised at the arrival, on the 15th
January (1813), of the following hurriedly written
note, bearing the Falmouth post-mark:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"You will be surprised, but I trust agreeably,
that I am landed on British ground. I made my
escape with some difficulty, though honourably,
from the Favourite Peninsula. I ventured my
carcass in the packet as the safest conveyance,
but it was like to have proved most woeful. Never
did I, nor probably ever shall I, suffer such distress.
Dreadful weather, and all but lost by bad reckoning
on the part of the marine tribe. We got

watery grave. I never felt till then <em>Danger</em>&mdash;in
its most pitiable state. I've been in contact with
my friend <em>Death</em> often, and rather familiar, but he
appeared at that moment more grim than usual.
I will recount my manifold adventures when we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
meet, which I hope will be in a few days. I touch
on my way at Morshead's and my friend Kelly's
near Launceston. You shall hear on what day I
can be with you.</p>

description."</p></div>

<p>Such was the home-coming of one of many
gallant men, who, broken down by the hardships
which they had endured while fighting for the
honour and glory of their country, arrived to find
their stay-at-home fellow-countrymen playing the
part of arm-chair critics, and decrying Wellington's
great work. These critics forgot the splendid
victories which the Commander-in-Chief had won,
and the fame which he had been building up for
England, and they remembered only what had
happened latest&mdash;the retreat from Burgos, which
they regarded, seemingly with joy, as a disaster to
British arms. Yet is it ever so.</p>

<span class="center xs">DRIVING THE FRENCH OUT OF SPAIN, 1813.</span></h2>

<p class="noindent">Major Rice was not fit to take the field again for
some months; Colonel Mitchell was also invalided
early in the year; and the junior major (Major
Roberts), therefore, had the good fortune to command
the 51st during the early part of the campaign
of 1813. The winter had been spent pleasantly
enough in cantonments, the officers hunting, shooting,
and holding race meetings; and although
sickness, resulting from the hardships of the past
year, was prevalent amongst the troops for some
time, the long rest completely restored the health
of the army.</p>

<p>In the early spring Wellington began to get his
divisions into fighting form for the coming campaign.
The retreat from Burgos showed him the necessity
of paying attention to discipline, in order to get
the men in hand again; exercise was also required
to enable them to cope with the physical exertions
to which he knew they would shortly be subjected;
and so, from February to April, regiments paraded
almost daily for brigade and divisional manœuvres,
and were constantly reviewed by their generals, as
well as by the Commander-in-Chief. By the middle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
of May all was ready for the great forward movement,
which, within a few weeks, resulted in
driving the enemy to the Pyrenees, and, before
the end of the year, into France.</p>

<p>At first sight it seems extraordinary that such
great success should have been in store for the
Allies, only recently suffering from what can but
be regarded as a somewhat ignominious handling
by the enemy, for it was all that they could do to
hold their own against him during the retreat to
Ciudad Rodrigo. The winter, however, had brought
about a change in the situation, and the complexion
of affairs was entirely altered, not only in the
Peninsula itself, but also in other parts of Europe.
Napoleon had met with disaster in Russia, and,
for the time being, the retreat from Moscow had
hipped him, yet with no crushing effect. He
required a leaven of seasoned troops wherewith
to stiffen his vast army of hastily-raised recruits,
and he therefore drew away from the Peninsula
thousands of his best officers and men. With joy
Wellington became aware of these events, and he
realised that at last his opportunity had come.
The Spanish and Portuguese Governments rose
to the occasion, and Wellington was given the
supreme command of the allied troops, numbering
in all parts of the Peninsula some 200,000 men
(including the British). But for his immediate
operations he could not reckon on more than
90,000; while the French still had in Spain
230,000, of whom, however, only 120,000, with
100 guns, were available to meet the Allies on the
northern line of invasion. "Yet this," says Napier,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
"was a great power, of one nation, one spirit, one
discipline"&mdash;as opposed to the heterogeneous force
of the three nations. Had Napoleon been in
personal command of his army in Spain, Wellington's
task would have been no light one, for the
Emperor grasped the situation even from afar, and
instructed his brother Joseph accordingly, enjoining
on him to act promptly and to concentrate
every available man in the north.</p>

<p>El Rey Joseph, however, was not the man for
the work; he preferred being a king to being
a commander-in-chief; he quarrelled with his
generals; he was slow and vacillating; and he
failed signally, so much so that when Wellington
opened the campaign Joseph's army was still
scattered. All this was much to Wellington's
advantage, and furthermore, he had the comfortable
feeling that, advancing with his left practically
in touch with the sea, the command of which his
fleet held, he could shift his base as occasion
demanded, and thus avoid the necessity of maintaining
a lengthy line of communications as his
army moved forward. In May 1813, therefore,
when Wellington had matured his plans, he felt
confident that he held Joseph Bonaparte in the
hollow of his hand; and he made certain that
there should be no loophole for failure. Ordering
Graham, with 40,000 men, to push through the
Portuguese province of Tras os Montes to the
Esla river, and thence outflank the French line
on the Douro, Wellington himself, with 30,000,
intended to march direct on Valladolid, where
King Joseph had his headquarters, and force the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
enemy back from the Douro. That accomplished,
and General Castaños with 20,000 Galicians having
joined, a new front was to be formed, when
the 90,000 Allies were to make a general advance
and, assailing the French all along the line, drive
them to the Pyrenees.</p>

<p>The 51st, in the 1st Brigade of the 7th Division
(General Lord Dalhousie), marched from its cantonments
on the 14th May, with Sir Thomas Graham's
force, to the north-west. On the 18th it crossed
the Douro, near Villa Nova, but not without
difficulty, the crossing being effected in boats, and
occupying twelve hours. Thence the direction of
the march was north-east, across the country
lying in the bend of the river, and on the 20th
Miranda de Douro was reached. After a halt of
five days, the 7th Division moved on to the Esla
river, and encamped on its banks from the 27th
to the 30th May. Wellington now came across to
see how Graham was progressing, and after a careful
reconnaissance of the Esla, he ordered the
troops to cross by a ford at daybreak on the 31st;
but, since the enemy was known to be in some
strength on the opposite bank, it was decided to
push a covering party of all arms across the river
during the dark hours of the night. This party
consisted of the hussar brigade, some artillery, the
51st, and 400 Brunswick light infantry, and at
1 <span class="xs">A.M.</span> on the 31st they moved down to the river.
Here the water was found to be deeper and the
current more rapid than had been anticipated, an
unexpected spate having come down during the
previous few hours, but it was all-important that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
the covering force should cross to the other side
before daybreak. Accordingly, the infantry were
instructed to hold on to the stirrup-leathers of
the hussars, and the passage began. For a time
the greatest confusion occurred; the rush of the
water caused the horses to plunge and rear;
several soldiers were swept off their feet, lost
their hold of the stirrup-leathers, and were
drowned. The bulk of the party, however, reached
the opposite bank in safety, though with their
ammunition saturated, shortly after dawn, and
found, to their relief, that the enemy had hastily
withdrawn, leaving only a cavalry piquet of forty
men to watch the ford. The Frenchmen retired
before the advancing hussars, who pursued at top
speed, and after a sharp skirmish captured nearly
all of them.</p>

<p>On the 1st June the 51st marched to Toro, and
on the following day pitched camp on its old
ground at Tordesillas. Here Wellington reviewed
the 6th and 7th Divisions, and having been joined
by the Galicians, was now ready, with his 90,000
men and 100 guns, for the great forward movement,
which he set going on the 4th June. King
Joseph, unable to obtain the reinforcements which
he had called up, thought first of making a stand
at Burgos, then withdrew to Pancorbo, and subsequently
to Vittoria. Wellington, following swiftly,
gave him no breathing space, but pressing on his
flanks on all occasions, forced him to give way.
Yet the king still regarded the retirement of his
army as merely a temporary expedient, and fully
believed that as soon as his reinforcements should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
join him he could turn the tables on his adversary.
But he was ignorant alike of Wellington's strength
and of the fact that the Allies' base had been
transferred from Lisbon to the ports of the Biscay
coast.</p>

<p>The Ebro was crossed on the 16th June, and on
the 20th the 51st, little thinking that the morrow
would bring forth a decisive battle, was within
a march of Vittoria. Wellington knew that King
Joseph intended to take up a position to cover the
place, which, with its vast accumulation of war
material and stores, besides a convoy of treasure
recently arrived from France for the payment of
the troops, could not readily be abandoned. And
Wellington was confident of a great victory.</p>

<p>Vittoria stood&mdash;as indeed it stands to-day&mdash;compactly
built on an eminence, rising up at the
end of a plain, or rather basin, some ten miles long
by eight miles broad. To the north of the town
the river Zadorra flows east and west for some
miles, until, on approaching the Morillas range,
it takes a sudden bend, almost at right angles, to
the south. Then, through the Pass of Pueblas, it
finds its way to the Ebro. Parallel to the main
course of the Zadorra, and at a distance of some
three miles to the north, runs a range of hills; on
the opposite bank, and five miles to its south, is
another parallel range; while the western edge
of the basin consists of the Morillas mountains,
pierced at one point&mdash;namely, the Pueblas defile.</p>

<p>It was behind this latter range that Wellington,
on the 20th June, had assembled his army. The
French defending Vittoria were holding the line of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
the Zadorra, intending to bar its passage at all
points. Seven bridges spanned the river, which,
though narrow, was deep, and in most parts flowed
between precipitous banks. Reille's corps, forming
the right of the French line, was posted to the
north of the town, with orders to hold the two
bridges at Gamara Mayor and Ariaga; Maransin's
brigade, on the extreme left, occupied the southern
range of hills, with the object of guarding that
flank and preventing the passage of the Pueblas
defile; while the centre of the enemy's line of
battle extended along the Hermandad ridge. Midway
between this ridge and the Morillas mountains
flowed the Zadorra, with four bridges at no great
distance apart. Wellington's plan was soon formed.
Graham, with twenty thousand men, was ordered
to march to the flank and attack Reille; Hill, with
another twenty thousand, was to force the passage
of the Pueblas defile, push back Maransin, and
seize the bridge of Nanclares. To the remainder
of the army, under the great commander himself,
was allotted the task of pouring over the Morillas
mountains on to the four bridges which lay below,
and of assaulting the enemy's centre.</p>

<p>Dawn of the 21st June was ushered in by
showers of rain and steamy heat. Hill moved
forward to attack Maransin, and met with considerable
opposition; but he succeeded in gaining
the heights, in passing his division through the
Pueblas defile, and in seizing the village of Subijana
de Alava. Meanwhile Graham had moved wide
away to the left, and the troops of Wellington's
main attack had crossed the Morillas mountains<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
and were nearing the bridges over the Zadorra&mdash;namely,
from left to right, Mendoza, Tres Puentes,
Villodas, and Nanclares. All this had taken time,
and it was past noon before the 51st, in the 1st
Brigade of the 7th Division, moved forward for
the general assault on the enemy's centre. Picton
was in chief command of this (the left) portion of
the attack, and moved the 3rd and 7th Division
rapidly down to the Mendoza bridge, the passage
of which was contested by the enemy's cavalry
and infantry, aided by his artillery. The British
had, however, already gained a footing on the left
bank of the river, as, finding that Tres Puentes
was unguarded, Wellington had hurried across it
Kempt's brigade of the Light Division and some
hussars. This cleared the way for Picton, for the
riflemen of Kempt's brigade made a spirited
attack on the enemy opposite the Mendoza bridge,
which was immediately crossed by a brigade of
the 3rd Division, the remainder of that division
and the 7th Division fording the river a little
higher up.</p>

<p>The fighting now became severe, as the Frenchmen
held tenaciously to their position on the
Hermandad ridge, and raked the assailants with
artillery fire from the village of Margarita, until
the 52nd Light Infantry coming up, charged the
enemy out of the village. The 3rd and Light
Divisions then pressed southwards and carried the
village of Ariñez, from which the defenders rapidly
withdrew. Thence the victorious Allies swept east,
and followed the French, now ordered to retire
upon Vittoria. Hill had worked his way forward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
on the right; the far-distant sounds of Graham's
attack on the left could be distinctly heard through
the din of battle; and Wellington knew that all
was going well.</p>

<p>At this juncture King Joseph began to realise
the situation; that his flanks were in imminent
danger, and that his centre, still six miles in front
of Vittoria, ran the risk of being cut off and annihilated;
so, unwillingly, he ordered a retirement.
And his men, magnificent soldiers that they were,
gave an object-lesson in the art of defending and
retiring from successive positions. The six miles of
country over which the ensuing running fight took
place was undulating, rough, and broken; and the
enemy, knowing each ridge, hillock, and fold in
the ground, made every use of such knowledge,
so that resistance was constant. Successive positions
were taken up, and defended with gun and
musket, until their defence seemed hopeless; and
each position abandoned told its tale of destruction&mdash;of
dead and wounded Frenchmen, and of captured
guns. Hour after hour the battle raged, and at
about six o'clock in the evening the enemy made
his last stand on a low ridge, barely a mile from
Vittoria, refusing to acknowledge even then that
he was beaten. Here stood eighty guns, pouring
grape and round shot on the assailants, while
amongst the guns and on their flanks the infantry
used their muskets with deadly effect. For the
moment the Allies were unable to face the storm,
and the French general, noticing the recoil of the
3rd Division, and under the impression that he
was fighting a rearguard action, commenced to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
withdraw the troops on his left flank. But the
4th Division, observing the movement, rushed
headlong on the retiring body, and carried the
position.</p>

<p>Then, and not till then, did King Joseph,
watching events from the town, understand that
the day was lost. Up till that moment he had
imagined his centre to be impregnable, his left
flank to be secure, and Reille still holding his
ground on the right. Yet there were few of the
inhabitants of Vittoria so sanguine as the king,
and early in the afternoon the roads running
east from the town were already blocked with carriages,
carts, and fugitives on foot. Then, when
the centre gave way, panic prevailed; the king
ordered the guns to take the road to Salvatierra;
the allied cavalry swept through and round
Vittoria, and the infantry followed with all
speed.</p>

<p>Vittoria, not fortified in any way, was evacuated;
but Reille still maintained his position, which he
now found to be most dangerous. Desperate
fighting had been going on all day in this part
of the field; Graham's men stormed the two
bridges, and carried them, but only to be driven
from them again, and kept at bay by Reille's
guns and infantry soldiers. A deadlock ensued;
neither side could make headway. Then Reille
suddenly became aware of the fact that Wellington's
troops were pouring between his rear and
the town, and that the victorious cavalry were
threatening to destroy him. In the nick of
time he saw the danger, skilfully disposed his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
troops, and with great gallantry fought his way
to Metauco, on the Salvatierra road, where he
attempted to form a rearguard to the fugitive
French army. Darkness alone saved him, for the
Allies, flushed with victory, pursued until they
could no longer distinguish friend from foe.</p>

<p>In this long battle, fought in the heat of a
Spanish summer, almost six thousand officers and
men fell on each side; but the rout of the enemy
was complete, and the French army in the
Peninsula had never experienced a more crushing
defeat. All their guns, their depôts of stores and
ammunition, their treasure chest, their wagons,
their records, and in fact everything that they
possessed, fell into the hands of the victors; and
the army that fled was a disorganised rabble,
having nothing but the clothes on their backs and
the muskets in their hands.</p>

<p>The 51st, which had been in the thick of the
fight all through, losing some forty-five officers
and men, bivouacked that night two miles from
Vittoria, and on the following day joined in the
pursuit of the enemy towards Pampeluna. The
Frenchmen were well on the run, and a rapid
pursuit would probably have resulted in their
complete dispersal, and in Wellington's immediate
invasion of France. But a rapid pursuit was
found to be impossible, for the reason that, as so
often had been the case before, victory had
proved too much for the Allies. "The night of
the battle," wrote Wellington, "instead of being
passed in getting rest and food to prepare the
soldiers for pursuit the following day, was passed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
by them in looking for plunder. The consequence
was that they were incapable of marching in
pursuit of the enemy and were totally knocked
up." Two days later, he stated that no fewer
than eight thousand British soldiers were absent,
and scattered all over the country marauding, and
that the majority of those who remained with
their regiments were under the influence of drink,
so that "when marches of over twelve miles
were attempted, the line of route was crowded
with stragglers and men seeking admittance to
hospital."</p>

<p>In spite of all this, Wellington started, on the
morning of the 22nd June, with six divisions and
the light cavalry, for Salvatierra, and on the
25th reached Pampeluna, which he immediately
blockaded. After much marching about during
the following few weeks, in the endeavour to clear
the whole country of the enemy, the 51st assisted
in driving the fugitives out of the valley of the
Bastan, and then followed towards the Pyrenees,
taking up a position at Echallar. During the last
week of July and the first week of August the
regiment came in for some sharp fighting, more
especially on the heights above Ostiz, where it
suffered the loss of thirty men, and again at the
pass of Dona Maria. From that time until the
end of August the 7th Division was occupied in
watching the passes of Echallar and Zagaramurdi;
but on the 30th it received sudden orders to
strike tents and march to the bridge of Lesaca,
for the purpose of covering the operations now in
active progress against San Sebastian.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span></p>

<p>Previous to this, Marshal Soult, who had
relieved King Joseph in supreme command of
the French army in the Pyrenees, had reorganised
his forces, and, towards the end of July, had made
a bold but unsuccessful attempt to relieve the
garrison of Pampeluna, being very severely handled
in withdrawing to the Pyrenees, and it was in his
overthrow that the 51st assisted at Ostiz, Dona
Maria, and elsewhere, as mentioned above. The
French marshal then took up a line of defence
along the right bank of the Bidassoa, from its
mouth up-stream to the village of Vera (situated
at the point where the river bends almost at right
angles), and onwards across the foothills and
ridges of the Pyrenees to St Jean Pied de Port.
In the meantime, Wellington, having disposed
his troops so as to watch Soult all along the
line, proceeded with the siege of San Sebastian,
the great fortress standing on the sea-coast,
some fifteen miles (as the crow flies) from Vera.
The place was strong, well-provisioned and well-garrisoned,
and Wellington was insufficiently
equipped to reduce it quickly; moreover, Soult's
activity necessitated the employment of large
bodies of the allied army at a distance from the
fortress. So much, in fact, was this the case
that, towards the end of July, Wellington was
obliged to utilise the services of so many of the
besieging troops elsewhere that he found it
necessary to convert the siege into a simple
blockade. When, however, he had got rid of all
these difficulties, and when Soult had been forced
back, Wellington found it possible to renew the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
siege of San Sebastian. The heavy guns and
other siege necessaries, for which he had waited
for so long, having arrived from England in the
middle of August, the British commander returned
to the charge with all the determination for which
he was ever noted. For ten days the great
guns battered the walls, during which period the
besiegers suffered severely from the fire of the
enemy's artillery, and were constantly called
upon to repel with the bayonet the sallies of the
garrison. To the men in the trenches it seemed
as if the capture of the place was still far off,
but Wellington thought otherwise, and on the
30th August he issued orders for the assault to
take place a little before noon next day, at the
same time instructing the troops covering the
siege to be prepared to frustrate any attempt by
Soult to interfere with the operations. It was
for that purpose that the 51st was despatched
with all haste to the Lesaca bridge, and thence
sent forward, with the rest of Inglis's brigade, to
support a Portuguese brigade on the slopes of the
Peña de Haya (known to the French as Mount
Aya, or Les Trois Couronnes).</p>

<p>The 31st August was a busy day, not only at
San Sebastian itself, but also with the covering
troops, for, as Wellington had anticipated, Soult
made a strenuous effort to interrupt the siege.
The country lying within the bend of the Bidassoa,
between Vera and San Sebastian, was wild and
mountainous, with few roads; and within that
bend the covering troops were in position facing
approximately east. Three bridges spanned the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
river&mdash;Behobia, close to its mouth, Vera, a little
above that village, and Lesaca, some three miles
higher up stream. These, therefore, were the
principal permanent crossings available for an
attack on the Allies' position from the east, except
that the Behobia bridge was broken and required
to be repaired. The river also, when low, could
be forded at two or three points between Vera
and Behobia; and since Soult possessed a pontoon
train, he could throw bridges across the river at
other points. Thus the Bidassoa, in its lower
course, presented but a slight obstacle to an
advance, though its passage might cause delay.</p>

<p>Soult's design was to pass some forty thousand
across the river at two different points, each body
fighting its way through the mountains until
Oyarzun was reached, when, the whole force
having concentrated, a fresh advance was to be
made towards San Sebastian, some six miles distant.
Wellington had foreseen all this, and had
made his dispositions accordingly, watching the
lower crossings from the heights of San Marcial,
and the fords and bridges about Vera from the
Peña de Haya&mdash;both strong and commanding
positions.</p>

<p>Before daylight, Reille, with eighteen thousand
men, forded the river near Behobia, and attacked
the Spanish force posted about San Marcial.
Wellington himself arrived on the scene at the
critical moment, and so inspired were the Spaniards
by his presence and exhortations that they fought
with the greatest valour, and succeeded in repulsing
the attack&mdash;even to driving the French into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
the river. While this was in progress, Clausel,
with twenty thousand Frenchmen, crossed by the
fords near Vera and assailed the slopes of the
Peña de Haya, held by the 9th Portuguese
Brigade, supported by General Inglis's brigade,
with which was the 51st, now commanded by
Colonel Mitchell. Here the French were too
strong for the defenders, who, resisting gallantly,
were forced back up the slopes until they reached
the 4th Division, at the foundry of San Antonio.
The fight which ensued was long and bickering,
and it was not until two in the afternoon that
Clausel's skirmishers reached San Antonio. Meanwhile
Wellington directed a portion of the Light
Division from Santa Barbara across the Upper
Bidassoa, to move by the Lesaca bridge, and,
taking some Spanish troops with them, to reinforce
Inglis. Clausel observing these movements, and
fearing for the safety of his left flank and rear,
halted his force and sent to Soult for orders.</p>

<p>The 51st lost heavily in its retirement up the
slopes to San Antonio, having one officer killed
and eleven officers wounded, and upwards of
seventy men killed or wounded. Nor was it possible
for the regiment, when forced back out of
San Antonio, to take all their wounded with them,
and in connection with this the following appears
in the records of the 51st: "Some of the wounded
had to be left behind, and they, falling into the
hands of the French, discovered that the regiment
with which they had been engaged was the
French 51st. Pointing to the common number,
the English soldiers were then received by their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
captors rather as distressed comrades than prisoners.
Their wants were immediately attended
to, their wounds dressed, and every article of their
personal property carefully preserved for them.
In the morning the French commenced their
retreat, and left their grateful prisoners to be reclaimed
by their regiment, which listened with
joy to the universal story of the kindness they
had experienced. 'This is the real chivalry of
modern warfare, and robs it of half its horrors.'"
At the time probably neither regiment knew, or
remembered, that just a year before they had been
in conflict at the Retiro, in Madrid, when the
eagle of the French 51st had been captured. But
this meeting of the British 51st with the French
51st is not without parallel in the annals of the
Peninsular War, for there are other instances of
the freemasonry of regimental numbers. In the
'Historical Records of the 43rd Light Infantry,'
the following incident is related: "In the evening
(December 12, 1813), on calling the roll of the
regiment, a dozen men were reported missing,
whereupon Colonel Napier despatched an officer
with a sergeant and patrol in quest. The men
were found in a small house filled with apples, on
most amicable terms with about as many French
soldiers&mdash;oddly enough, belonging to the Imperial
43rd. The same object, that of securing the
tempting fruit, had impelled both parties to the
spot, and all had gone on the apple raid unarmed.
The French, on observing that the English bore
'43' on their breastplates, examined them attentively,
cordially shook hands, and expressed much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
pleasure in the accidental <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rencontre</i>, asking many
questions as to rations and allowances; and assured
them that if they would accompany them to a
post a little way off they would give them some
first-rate brandy. Upon the appearance of the
officer, the Frenchmen, believing themselves prisoners,
brought forth the whole of their spoil as a
peace-offering: but he merely pointed to the door,
whence they effected their escape, while the English
truants, with crammed haversacks, were escorted
back to their quarters."</p>

<p>In those days the British soldier gloried in the
number of his regiment, and doubtless the French
soldier did so also. Under such circumstances
one can easily understand that the number should
have become a bond of union, even between men
who when on duty were ready to bayonet one
another. There is no doubt that, apart from such
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">entente cordiale</i> incidents as the above, the power
of the regimental number was great; the traditions
of the regiment were built up round its number,
and when, in 1881, a civilian Secretary of State
for War thought fit to substitute county titles for
the old numbers, he introduced the most unpopular
army reform ever devised by a War Minister. In the
eyes of a civilian it may have been a small matter,
but it was a bid to destroy the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">esprit de corps</i> of
half the army. That it did not seriously affect
regiments was due to the fact that they steered a
middle course, styling themselves officially by
their new county titles, and unofficially retaining
their ancient numbers.</p>

<p>But to return to the events of the 30th August<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
1813: while Clausel awaited Soult's orders at
San Antonio, Reille had renewed the attack on
San Marcial. For some hours the Spaniards continued
to hold their own, but it is doubtful if they
could have done so much longer, when fortunately
the elements came to their aid. At about 3 <span class="xs">P.M.</span>
there fell on the combatants one of the most violent
storms ever experienced even in these lofty mountains,
and the tempest of wind and rain raged for
two or three hours, pinning the assailants to the
ground and making further progress absolutely impossible.
As darkness came on Reille succeeded in
withdrawing his force across the river, but Clausel,
who had now been ordered by Soult to retire from
San Antonio, was less fortunate, for although he
himself with two brigades succeeded in fording the
Bidassoa near Vera, his lieutenant, General Vandermaesen,
with the remainder of the troops, was
cut off by the rising waters. His sole prospect of
escape from this perilous situation was by forcing
the passage of the guarded bridge a little above
Vera, and this, during the dark and stormy night,
he was successful in doing, though at the cost of
his own life, and with the loss of nearly three
hundred of his men. Soult's attempt, therefore,
to interrupt the operations against San Sebastian
had proved a dismal failure, and while the covering
force had been employed in thus holding the
French in check, the great fortress had fallen,
after an assault as desperate and as bloody as that
which had won Badajoz in the previous year.</p>

<p>But Wellington had now cleared up the situation,
for, save the garrison of the castle within<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
San Sebastian, which held out for a few days
longer, and that of Pampeluna, which was kept
locked up until its capitulation in November, no
Frenchmen (other than those of Suchet's corps
in Catalonia) tarried beyond the Spanish slopes of
the Pyrenees. It remained for the Allies to drive
them through the mountains into France, and
there was still heavy fighting in front of them.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">CHAPTER XII.</a><br />
<span class="center xs">THE CLOSE OF THE PENINSULAR WAR.</span></h2>

<p class="noindent">Any one who has read a great number of letters
from the Peninsula must often have been struck
by the marked difference between those written
by young officers and those by their seniors. The
older men were often despondent in times of hardship,
and were generally critical of the actions of
those in command; while the subalterns and
younger captains seem to have been ever in high
spirits, and bubbling over with youth and gaiety.
There is no doubt that, as far as regimental officers
were concerned, this matter of youth put an immense
amount of dash into all the operations
undertaken, and inspired the soldiers with courage
as well as with confidence. And it is not too
much to say that an army officered by a preponderance
of middle-aged men would have taken
twice as long to rid northern Spain of the French.
The human factor in warfare is usually overlooked
by the casual reader of military history; he knows
the characteristics of the chief commanders in a
campaign; he knows such well-worn theories as
Napoleon's presence on a battlefield being equivalent
to forty thousand men; but otherwise he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
regards battalions as composed of officers and men
all turned out of the same mould&mdash;of like temperament,
of like age, and of like physique.</p>

<p>Now, if a study were made of the average ages
of British regimental officers in the several campaigns
of the hundred years ending 1908, it would
probably be found that they varied very considerably,
and it might be interesting to discover
whether the ages of the officers affected the "go"
of the campaign one way or the other. But, as
concerns the Peninsular army, it is an undoubted
fact that regimental officers were far younger than
they have ever been since. As a rule, an officer
was a captain within six years of joining his regiment,
and, unless unfortunate, a major within
another six years, while, with any luck, he obtained
the command of his regiment before he was
much over thirty years of age. Napier gives
many instances: Lieut.-Colonel Charles Macleod,
who was killed at the head of the 43rd in the
breach at Badajoz, had not reached his 27th year;
Lieut.-Colonel Thomas Lloyd fell leading the 94th
at the battle of Nivelle, at the age of thirty; Sir
William Napier himself was only twenty-nine
when he finished his last campaign, and his
brother, Sir George, was but a year older at the
close of the Peninsular War; Sir John Colborne
(Lord Seaton) considered himself a most unlucky
man in not having obtained the command of a
regiment until he was thirty-two; and many
other cases might be cited of the youth of the
senior officers of regiments. These were the men
who led their battalions to victory after victory,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
and their subordinates were for the most part mere
boys. Many fought through the Peninsular War
while still in their teens, and Colborne affirmed
that, when he was commanding the 66th, he was
the only officer of the regiment over twenty-five
years of age. We know that young Mainwaring,
of the 51st, aged fourteen, was leading the veterans
of the regiment at Fuentes d'Onor, and we have
his own word for it, that when he entered Madrid
with the victorious army he was so young that
the gaieties of the city failed to amuse him, and
that he preferred to spend his evenings quietly
with the old Spanish couple upon whom he was
billeted. And most regiments, doubtless, had ensigns
as young as Mainwaring.</p>

<p>We of to-day naturally question the value of
such youthful officers&mdash;lads who nowadays would be
in the ranks of their school cadet corps. Yet it is
an extraordinary fact that these boys commanded
men often old enough to be their fathers, and were
followed by them with the greatest devotion. Sir
William Napier writes of one of his subalterns,
Edward Freer, killed at the battle of the Nivelle,
that, though only a lieutenant, he "was rich in
honour, for he bore many scars and was young of
days. He was only nineteen, but had seen more
combats and sieges than he could count years.
Slight in person, and of such surpassing and
delicate beauty that the Spaniards often thought
him a girl disguised in man's clothing, he was yet
so vigorous, so active, so brave, that the most
daring and experienced veterans watched his looks
on the field of battle, and would obey his slightest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
sign in the most difficult situations.... He was
pierced with three balls at the first storming of the
Rhune rocks, and the sternest soldiers in the regiment
wept even in the middle of the fight when
they heard of his fate."</p>

<p>There is no shadow of doubt that, young as they
were, the regimental officers of this period, taken
as a whole, knew their business thoroughly; that
is to say, the commanding officer could handle his
regiment with skill, and the captains and subalterns
were expert company officers both in the field and
in quarters. The majority of them possessed initiative,
and in the fight seldom made a mistake or
missed an opportunity. Their school was war, and
in that rough-and-ready school they picked up all
that they knew, for few of them, except those who
had been trained under Sir John Moore at Shorncliffe,
had learned anything of soldiering before
they landed in the Peninsula. Even the most
hypercritical of modern writers must admit that the
officer of a hundred years ago performed the duties
of the rank for which he drew pay well and truly
and to the best of his ability. And what more,
it may be asked, can be expected of any one?
Certainly the State had no cause for complaint
that it was not getting good value for its money,
for it paid its infantry captains no more than ten
shillings and sixpence a-day, and its ensigns half
that sum, for doing their duty nobly, for undermining
their constitutions through exposure, privation,
and hardships, and for risking their lives
for days, weeks, months, and years on end. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
were practical, fighting soldiers; but there have
arisen modern critics who say of them that their
minds were small and undeveloped, because they
were not students of the military art, because they
had not read military history and therefore did not
realise that history is always repeating itself, and
because such things as strategy and grand tactics
were outside their sphere of thought. We do not
deny that if these officers were aiming at something
higher than regimental soldiering, there is a
measure of sense in these criticisms; but we would
point out that, except in the case of one or two
senior officers in each regiment, there had been no
time for the study of books; for if we accept the
statement that captains and subalterns were under
twenty-five years of age at the close of the
Peninsular War, and that most of them had been
on active service practically from the day they
joined, we fail to see when they could have read
military history. And, even if they had had
leisure to read such works on military history as
were available a hundred years ago, there is no
reason to suppose that their duties, as simple
regimental officers, would have been performed the
better. Afterwards many of them went to High
Wycombe (Staff College) to continue their study
of the art of war, the practical part of which they
had already learned, and it was not found that
their experience of war had in any way impaired
their reasoning powers.</p>

<p>But in the Peninsula, youth and ignorance of
military history do not appear to have interfered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
with successful leading, and he who delights to
read of gallant deeds will find, in the accounts of
the various fights, scores of episodes in which boy
officers set brilliant examples to their men, and by
their valour at a critical moment often saved the
day. Such were the leaders of Forlorn Hopes and
of similar desperate enterprises, and it would seem
as if these lads must have matured much more
rapidly than do the boys of the present age. Yet
it may be that the rank and file were so magnificent
that, at ordinary times, they were capable of being
driven with a silken thread. That the soldiers, in
spite of Wellington's dictum as to their being "the
scum of the earth," were magnificent, is certain, and
it is equally certain that they were devoted to
their officers. There is scarcely a regiment in
the army whose history does not record some
gallant act performed by a soldier to save the life
of an officer; and these rugged veterans went out
of their way to show kindness to the boy subalterns
in times of sickness or of hardship.</p>

<p>It may be thought that, with older officers, the
frequent outbreaks of indiscipline which sullied the
good name of Wellington's soldiers might have
been avoided. But who can say whether the great
captain would have benefited in the long-run?
Occasionally his operations were delayed by the
marauding and drunkenness of his troops, but
there is no proof that his plans ever broke down
owing to the youth of his regimental officers, and
he never appears to have complained that they
were too young, though he may have hinted that
a few of his generals were too old, for some of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
them were ten years older than himself.<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> But it
may seem extraordinary that officers of the army
as a whole should have been so young towards the
end of the Peninsular War, for one has always
imagined that, under the Purchase System, promotion
was remarkably slow. Still, the wastage
produced by the long war was enormous; deaths,
wounds, and disease ploughed deep into the commissioned
ranks; and to keep up the supply of
officers was no easy matter. Officers, captains as
well as subalterns, were transferred from the
militia to the regular army;<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> from time to time
non-commissioned officers were promoted ensigns,
for good service in the field; but the majority of
commissions were given to cadets of the Royal
Military College,<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> at the average age of fifteen,
or to boys, equally young, appointed direct to
regiments.</p>

<p>The loss of twelve officers and seventy-two men
(killed or wounded), in the fighting of the 31st
August, reduced the strength of the 51st woefully,
and it was one of the regiments which could least
afford such a depletion, since it was in the unfortunate
situation of having no second battalion
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>in England upon which to fall back for reinforcements
of officers and men. Most regiments in the
field had a second battalion at home, ready to
make good the casualties in the foreign battalion
as they occurred, but the fate of the 51st had been
against its ever having been able to recruit a
second battalion. The 68th, also, with which the
51st had been brigaded for the greater part of the
war, was suffering from the same cause, and so
reduced in numbers were the two regiments that
it became a great question what to do with them.
The regiments themselves were for linking up and
forming themselves into what was termed a "provisional
battalion," and Wellington agreed to the
proposal; but the authorities at home, refusing to
sanction anything of the kind, informed Wellington
that, if he deemed it necessary, he could send the
regiments home to recruit up to strength. But the
Commander-in-Chief had no intention of parting
with any of his tried soldiers, and he preferred
weak battalions of veterans to full ones of recruits,
so the 51st and 68th remained with Inglis's brigade
of the 7th Division, to fight the war to a finish.</p>

<p>After the fall of San Sebastian, the 51st recrossed
to the right bank of the Bidassoa and occupied its
former position near Santa Barbara, facing Vera.
Here it remained throughout the month of September,
and early in October moved to Echallar,
to await the development of Wellington's plans.
Major Rice, who had been kept in England after
the expiration of his sick leave, because the
authorities thought that Wellington would send
the regiment home, now rejoined, in the best of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
health and spirits, though disappointed at having
missed the three months' fighting in which his
regiment had taken part. He saw, however, that
he was still in time to take his share of plenty of
rough work; and so it proved.</p>

<p>Wellington, having driven the French out of
northern Spain into the Pyrenees, at first had no
intention of following them into France, his reasons
being that Napoleon might at any moment send
reinforcements to Soult, and that a French army
(under Suchet) was still in possession of the
Mediterranean province of Catalonia, in eastern
Spain. With Suchet in his rear, his position was
insecure; and if large reinforcements were despatched
to Soult, the allied army might fare
badly, although the proximity of the sea-base
rendered disaster impossible. When, therefore,
San Sebastian fell, Wellington inclined to transfer
the war to Catalonia, but political pressure from
home and the news of Napoleon's misfortunes in
Germany combined to cause him to change his
plans, when, as Napier says, he "matured an
offensive movement as daring as any undertaken
during the whole war"&mdash;in short, an assault on
Soult's whole line of fortifications in the Pyrenees,
and the invasion of France.</p>

<p>Between the opposing armies the Bidassoa
flowed from Vera to the sea; but to the north
and north-east of Vera there was no such well-marked
dividing line&mdash;only the labyrinth of
rocky spurs and ravines which seamed the
mountain-slopes. Wellington's plan was to advance
simultaneously on the right and on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
left, the troops on the right storming Soult's
fortified posts among the mountains, while those
on the left forced the passage of the Lower
Bidassoa. These operations were to have commenced
ill the middle of September, but, owing to
faulty arrangements in the matter of pontoons and
subsequently to bad weather, they were deferred
until the 6th October. That night everything
was got ready, and at daybreak next morning
Wellington's carefully laid plans were set going,
their extraordinary boldness altogether deceiving
Soult.</p>

<p>Under the protection of a heavy cannonade
from San Marcial and the neighbourhood, the
divisions on the left forded the Lower Bidassoa
at several points almost before the French had
fired a shot, and, turning the enemy out of his
positions, crossed the frontier into France. At
the same time, the Light Division advancing on
Vera, and thence up the mountain-slopes, carried
position after position with astounding impetuosity;
while, farther away on the right, the 7th Division
and others guarded the Echallar pass and various
roads and tracks through the mountains. Desultory
fighting went on upon the crests of the Pyrenees
during the next two days, after which Wellington
called a halt, and from his headquarters at Vera
reorganised the commands of his army. Hill was
given the right, from Roncesvalles to the Bastan;
Beresford the centre, which included Echallar,
where the 7th Division was posted; and Hope
the left, from the Mandale mountain to the sea.
Tents were brought up, and the troops encamped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
on their several positions, eagerly awaiting the
order to move forward; but Wellington had not
yet decided finally whether to invade France or
to move back into Spain and carry the war into
Catalonia. A month was thus spent, in the most
inclement weather, on the summits of the bleak
Pyrenees, and the allied army suffered great
hardships, some of the posts being at times
snowed up and cut off from provisions. Fortunately
they were provided with tents&mdash;though
they were a cold comfort; nevertheless, the shelter
which they afforded was certainly preferable to
bivouacs among the rocks.</p>

<p>Prior to the opening of the campaign of 1813,
regiments had been unacquainted with the luxury
of canvas, and it is wonderful how they managed
to exist for so many years in such variations of
climate. Whenever possible, the troops were
billeted in the towns, villages, and farms; but
when actually in the field the bivouac was resorted
to, and as time went on the old soldiers became
adepts at making themselves comfortable, in
shelters formed of boughs of trees, or even in
hastily constructed huts, when halting in the more
wooded parts of the country. In 1812, tents were
improvised out of blankets, two of which were
fastened together by tapes sewn on to the sides,
and then stretched over a pole supported by the
arm piles; but these provided shelter for only
four men, who, moreover, had but two blankets
among them in which to sleep. The whole matter
was one of transport, and Wellington had always
refused to allow the movements of his army to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
hampered by excessive baggage. By this time,
however, the medical officers had learnt by experience
that much of the sickness of the army was
attributable to exposure, and the authorities at
length sanctioned the issue of four tents per
company, three for the men and one for the
officers, but their carriage was not to entail any
increase in the number of transport animals.
Hitherto the company mules carried nothing
except the heavy iron camp-kettles, or cauldrons,
but now these were exchanged for lighter ones of
tin, which the men (six to a kettle) took it in
turn to carry on their knapsacks, while the mules
carried the tents.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Soult had taken advantage of the
inaction of his foe, and had caused to be thrown
up a complete chain of entrenchments, some thirty
miles long, covering St Jean de Luz on his right,
and extending along the course of the Nivelle
to its upper waters, whence the left of his line
stretched eastward to the river Nive. The centre
was guarded by outworks, erected about the
Smaller Rhune and Sarre, to the east of the
Greater Rhune; and so strong was this vast line
that the most careful reconnaissances could discover
scarcely a single weak spot in it.</p>

<p>At length Wellington made up his mind to
move on into France, for he had now learned that
Suchet would not co-operate with Soult, and he
had learned also that Napoleon had met with
successes in Germany. The time, therefore, was
opportune to attack Soult, and to delay might
result in his opponent receiving reinforcements<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
from Napoleon. The British commander arrived
at this decision early in November, and on the
9th issued his orders. His plan was to strike at
the French centre, cross the Nivelle at the bridge
of Amotz, and attempt to divide Soult's force.
Before any general advance could be made, however,
it was necessary to clear the foreground by
capturing the outworks in the Pyrenees, and the
Light Division, still in position about the Greater
Rhune, facing the strongly fortified Smaller Rhune,
not a mile distant, was ordered to push forward on
the morrow. This the regiments of the famous
division did in the most gallant manner, thus
opening what was known as the battle of the
Nivelle, and sweeping the Frenchmen from their
fortified posts at the point of the bayonet.</p>

<p>The strength of the enemy's right determined
Wellington to make no immediate advance on
that side, but to bring round Hill's and Beresford's
divisions in a species of gigantic wheel, so as to
cross the Nivelle above and below the bridge of
Amotz, and cut Soult's army in two. While,
therefore, the Light Division was fighting its way
through the enemy's advanced works, the 4th and
7th Divisions were sent against the forts of San
Barbe and Grenada. It was a day of grand work,
but we can do no more than follow the fortunes of
the 51st, in Inglis's brigade of the 7th Division.</p>

<p>By a stroke of luck for Major Sam Rice,
Colonel Mitchell had been placed on the sick list
at Echallar, and the command of the regiment
devolved on the major, who soon showed that
he was equal to the responsibility. From the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
mouth of the Echallar pass, the 7th Division
advanced rapidly on the Grenada fort, which
covered the village of Sarre, while the 4th
Division moved against the neighbouring fort of
San Barbe, the regiments carrying scaling-ladders,
wherewith, if necessary, to storm the works.
Such aids, however, were not needed, for the
defenders, powerless to withstand the fire of the
eighteen British guns which accompanied the
attack, fled from the forts, and though they stood
for a while at Sarre, they soon broke before the
determined onslaught of the pursuers. The victorious
divisions, as they forged ahead, presently
found themselves confronted by two redoubts,
Louis XIV. and Harastaguia. The former was
immediately stormed and carried at the point of
the bayonet, and attention was then paid to the
latter, in front of which the 31st French Regiment
had been placed as a covering force. Upon this
unfortunate regiment the 7th Division fell forthwith,
breaking it and putting it to the rout, and
driving the garrison from the redoubt&mdash;even to
the banks of the Nivelle.</p>

<p>The French, pursued vigorously by the 4th and
7th Divisions, crossed the river by the various
bridges, and took up positions on the heights
above St Pé, whereupon Wellington, halting the
other divisions, pushed the 3rd and the 7th across
the river against Maransin's French division,
which stood its ground and fought desperately.
"After a hard struggle, in which General Inglis
was wounded, and the 51st and 68th Regiments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
were handled very roughly,"<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> the attack succeeded,
and Maransin's troops were put to flight.
Thus, at nightfall, when darkness put an end to
the fight, the British had established themselves
in rear of the French right, and Wellington had
reason to be proud of the valour of his troops.
In his despatch he included the following: "I
likewise particularly observed the gallant conduct
of the 51st and 68th Regiments under command
of Major Rice and Lieut.-Colonel Hawkins, in
Major-General Inglis's brigade, in the attack of
the heights above St Pé, in the afternoon of the
10th." On this day the 51st lost two officers and
twenty-two men killed, two officers and seventy-three
men wounded, and one officer (Captain
Phelps) taken prisoner. "Major Rice," says the
'Records of the 51st Regiment,' "commanding
the regiment on this occasion in the absence of
Colonel Mitchell, detained at Echallar by sickness,
was rewarded for his bravery by a lieutenant-colonelcy
and the Gold Medal."</p>

<p>The Peninsular Gold Medal was a much-coveted
decoration, for it was given sparingly, and only
to selected officers, for certain engagements. No
officer could claim the right to receive it, but as
the war progressed regulations were issued from
time to time, and recommendations for the decoration
were restricted to certain ranks for the satisfactory
performance of certain duties. It must
be remembered that, at the commencement of the
Peninsular War, medals were almost unknown in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
the British army. A few had been struck to
commemorate great naval victories, but they
were bestowed at first only on the chief commanders,
though towards the close of the eighteenth
century a wider distribution was made to
the navy and marines. Soldiers, however, knew
nothing of medals, and even Sir John Moore,
with all his war service, died without ever having
received a medal.<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> The suggestion of granting
medals to officers engaged in the war in the
Peninsula probably came from Sir Arthur Wellesley,
who had recently come from India, where
the Honourable East India Company was accustomed
to issue medals to all its native troops for
the various Indian wars. Gold medals in two
sizes were therefore struck and granted to senior
officers, the larger medals being given to generals
and the smaller to other officers, as a rule not
below the rank of major. On one side of the
medal was the name of the action for which it
was granted, and on the principle of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">bis dat qui
cito dat</i>, the medals were distributed as soon as
possible after the action, being sent out for the
purpose to the seat of war.</p>

<p>As time went on senior officers began to accumulate
many medals, since they received one for
each great battle or siege; and the authorities
deemed it advisable to issue no more than one
medal to an officer, engraving upon it subsequently
the names of all the general actions at which he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
was present. Presently a fresh difficulty arose:
the actions became too numerous to admit of their
names being engraved on the limited space of the
medal; so, eventually, in 1813, regulations concerning
the issue of gold medals were finally
approved. It was then laid down that an officer
should wear only one gold medal, upon which
should be engraved the first action in which he
was engaged; that for the second and third action
he should receive gold clasps, inscribed with the
names of the actions. The fourth action entitled
the officer to the Gold Cross, upon which were
engraved all four actions, and which was to be
worn in substitution of the gold medal and clasps
previously received; and gold clasps were added
to the ribbon of the gold cross for each subsequent
action after the original four.</p>

<p>As far as regimental officers were concerned,
the commanding officer of a full battalion present
in an action for which a commemorative medal was
struck<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> was usually recommended for the smaller
gold medal (or clasp if he was already in possession
of the medal), even though he might have
been a major temporarily in command. As a rule,
no other regimental officer received the medal for
services performed as such, but occasionally a
major or a captain was given the decoration<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
for some particularly brilliant service, for which
nowadays he would be awarded the V.C. or the
D.S.O. But anything like a general distribution
of medals to every one engaged was not given a
thought; in fact the idea of wearing medals at all
was so new that the majority of officers and men
of the army regarded such things as far beyond
their reach; and it was not until after the issue of
a silver medal to all ranks of the army present at
Waterloo, that Peninsular veterans began to consider
themselves slighted. Yet for upwards of
thirty years they agitated in vain, and only in
1848 was justice done to them by the issue of
a silver medal, with clasps. Probably, by that
time, the greater number of these brave men had
passed away, for, between 1808 and 1848, thousands
had been killed in action, died of wounds or of
disease contracted on active service, died in afterlife
from the effects of exposure and hardships
during long years of campaigning, or died of old
age.</p>

<p>The regimental officers, perhaps, felt the non-recognition
of their services more than did the
men, for they argued that they had shared in
many Peninsular victories as hard-fought as
Waterloo, and had nothing to show for them
except the scars on their bodies. And they felt
the injustice the more when they remembered the
manner in which the gold medal had been awarded.
Almost every officer on the staff&mdash;even the most
junior in field rank&mdash;had received it as a matter
of course; but no such generosity had been extended
to regimental officers, few of whom had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
been able to fulfil the qualifications prescribed by
the authorities. There were captains and subalterns
who had fought in battles and sieges
innumerable, often severely wounded and even
maimed for life, yet who went undecorated; while
there were majors, perhaps but once engaged, who,
by a stroke of fortune, brought their regiments out
of action, and thereby qualified for recommendation
for the gold medal. Major Sam Rice, however,
was not one of these, for he had seen as much
service as any officer of the 51st. Still, but for
the temporary illness of his commanding officer,
his Peninsular services would have gone unrewarded.</p>

<p>After the battle of the Nivelle, Soult withdrew
his main body to the entrenched camp at
Bayonne. He destroyed the bridge at Ustaritz,
and disposed his troops along the right bank of
the river Nive, so as to watch all the other crossings.
The weather favoured him; for, throughout
the next eight days, rain fell incessantly, the river
came down in flood, and the roads, knee-deep in
mud and slush, were practically impassable, so
that Wellington was restrained from following up
his victory. Further circumstances, moreover,
forced delay upon him: the Spanish troops, elated
at the invasion of France, murdered and pillaged
the unfortunate inhabitants far and wide, and so
incensed was Wellington at their conduct that he
forthwith put to death all whom he took red-handed,
and sent the Spanish divisions, composed
of some 25,000 men, back across the frontier, to
their own country, although by so doing he fore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>saw
the possibility of serious trouble with the
Spanish Government.</p>

<p>Wellington now felt his way cautiously, his
available troops being too few to run any great
risks, and he would not have moved forward immediately
except for the fact that the enemy still
had a footing at one point on the left bank of the
Nive. This was at the Cambo bridge, which,
covered by a bridge-head on the left bank, was a
source of grave concern to the British commander,
since its possession could be taken advantage of
by Soult to launch an attack on Wellington's right
flank. On the 16th November, therefore, Hill was
ordered to move out and threaten the bridge-head,
an operation which was completely successful, as
the enemy made no stand, but, blowing up the
bridge-head and the bridge, evacuated the left
bank of the river at the first sight of Hill's reconnaissance.
With the Nive between his right flank
and the French, Wellington knew that he could
bide his time, and complete his preparations for a
further advance. And it was nearly a month
before he pushed on again.</p>

<p>Between the 8th and 13th December the fighting
was heavy and almost continuous, but the 51st
saw little of it, being moved about from point to
point, in reserve, and being brought up at the
concluding action at St Pierre only when the day
had been won. But in these stoutly contested
battles before Bayonne, otherwise known as the
"Battles of the Nive," the Anglo-Portuguese force
had met with great successes, had crossed that
river, and had pushed the enemy back upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
Bayonne, thus earning the well-merited praise of
its commander, who himself averred that, had he
gone against his conscience and brought up the
25,000 disgraced Spaniards, he would have carried
Bayonne and driven Soult's army to the winds.
As it was, he held the line which he had gained
until he opened the campaign of 1814, and commenced
the final phase of the long war.</p>

<p>At the time Wellington had the unpleasant
feeling that the Spanish Government, smarting
under the insult which had been offered to the
national army, would join the French, and force
the British commander to fight for the embarkation
of his army. Within the next few weeks,
however, the political situation cleared up, and
Soult began to suffer from the calls made upon
him by Napoleon to supply reinforcements for the
army with which he was endeavouring to stem the
tide of German invasion on the eastern frontiers of
France. Soult still held the fortress of Bayonne,
standing at the confluence of the Nive with the
Adour, and up-stream from Bayonne he held the
right bank of the Adour as far as the mouth of the
river Bidouse, whence his line, bending southwards
almost at right angles, followed the right bank of
the latter river. Wellington's immediate objective
was Bayonne, the investment of which place he
had determined to effect at once, and for this purpose
it was necessary to throw a portion of his
army across the Adour. With the sea at his
command, he decided to cross the river below
Bayonne, and in order to distract Soult's attention
from that direction he threatened the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
French centre and left, about the upper Adour
and Bidouse, with all the troops whom he could
spare.</p>

<p>Towards the middle of February (1814) the
operations commenced. On the 26th, Hope, with
magnificent skill, threw a bridge of boats across
the Adour, at the point some three hundred
yards wide, and completed the investment of
Bayonne forthwith. Meanwhile Soult's troops
had been kept fully occupied among the rivers
and streams to the eastward, and on the 27th
was fought the battle of Orthes. The 51st, which,
with the 7th Division (forming part of Beresford's
command), had been pushing the French north-eastward
from the river Bidouse during the previous
week, found itself on the morning of the 27th
near St Boes, opposite the enemy's right. Soult
had taken up a strong position along the heights
extending from St Boes to the Gave de Pau about
the village of Orthes, and had made up his mind
to give battle. Wellington was ready to meet
him. Beresford, with the 4th and 7th Divisions,
was ordered to attack the right from the north-west;
Hill, with the 2nd Division, moving from
the south bank of the Gave de Pau, was directed
to advance on the bridge of Orthes and turn the
French left; while Picton, with the 3rd and 6th
Divisions, and Alten, with the Light Division, held
the centre.</p>

<p>The battle was opened by Beresford at about
9 <span class="xs">A.M.</span>, but, although he pushed in the enemy's
right and carried the village of St Boes, he was in
turn forced to retire, and was roughly handled by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
the French guns. Picton, who had at the same
time been pressing forward against the centre, met
with no better success, and was also driven back.
For the moment the situation was critical, and it
seemed as if Soult would snatch a victory; but
Wellington's master-mind realised what was
happening, and, quick as thought, he hurled a
counter-attack of Alten's and Picton's men in
between two parts of the French army which had
become separated. Beresford turned, recaptured
St Boes, and cut off Soult's retreat by the Dax
road; and at the same time Hill forded the Gave
de Pau a little above Orthes, and menaced Soult's
left. The French, smitten in front and flank,
drew off rapidly to the north-east, and the battle
resolved itself into a race between Hill's Division
and Soult's army for the bridge at Sault de
Navailles, three miles away. The retreat was
well carried out, and though Hill's cavalry pursued
with a certain amount of success, Soult contrived
to pass the bridge and destroy it, thus putting an
end to the pursuit.</p>

<p>This was the last general action of the Peninsular
War in which the 51st was engaged, for although
the regiment crossed the Adour at St Sever, and
advanced as far as Mont de Marsan, it was then
detached, in order to accompany Beresford to
Bordeaux, which city was wavering between
allegiance to Napoleon or to the Bourbons. To
settle matters, and to give confidence to the
Bourbon party, Wellington sent Beresford with
twelve thousand men, and the appearance of this
force before Bordeaux, on the 12th March, had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
the desired result; whereupon Beresford, leaving
Lord Dalhousie with the 7th Division and three
squadrons of cavalry to occupy the place, marched
back to the army. But as soon as Beresford had
departed, the Napoleonists took heart and attempted
an insurrection, in which they were
supported by the advance of a French force from
outside. For the next few weeks, therefore, the
51st was constantly engaged in skirmishes with
the enemy, who was eventually dispersed by the
arrival of a British fleet in the Garonne.</p>

<p>While these events were passing in the neighbourhood
of Bordeaux, Wellington was following
Soult. On the 20th March, a short but fierce
fight at Tarbes resulted in the defeat of the French,
who, however, retiring towards Toulouse, continued
to dispute the advance of the Allies towards the
upper Garonne, until, on the 10th April, Wellington
caught them at Toulouse, and overthrew them.
With this victory the war was brought to a close,
for, the day after Wellington entered the town,
the news of Napoleon's abdication was received
from Paris, and the preliminaries for a permanent
peace were entered into.</p>

<p>At Bordeaux the 51st remained in the enjoyment
of a good deal of pleasure and gaiety until
July, when it embarked for England, and proceeded
first to Plymouth and then to Portsmouth, from
which latter place it had started three years and
a half before for the Peninsula. In that time the
regiment had lost many officers and a great
number of men, but these gallant dead had helped
to gain seven fresh battle honours for the colours<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
of the 51st. Personal rewards were restricted to
the three senior officers, each of whom received
the Gold Medal and brevet promotion, otherwise
the officers and men found their reward only in
the knowledge that they had fought for the glory
of England, and had upheld the good name of
their regiment. Napier, in the concluding paragraph
of his 'Battles and Sieges,' writes of the
Peninsular army as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Thus the war terminated, and with it all remembrance
of the veterans' services. Yet those
veterans had won nineteen pitched battles and
innumerable combats; had made or sustained ten
sieges, and taken four great fortresses; had twice
expelled the French from Portugal, once from
Spain; had penetrated France, and killed, wounded,
or captured two hundred thousand enemies&mdash;leaving
of their own number forty thousand dead,
whose bones whiten the plains and mountains of
the Peninsula."</p>
</div>

<p>But, if one turns to the lighter side of the war,
one gathers from the journals and letters of officers
that, in all this campaigning, with its attendant
bloodshed and misery, there was usually some
bright lining to the cloud. The vast majority of
the officers, as has been shown, were of an age
particularly susceptible to sparkling eyes and suchlike
things, and the Spanish and French ladies
appear to have been no less susceptible to the
charming manners of the brave young Englishmen&mdash;even
though the latter loved and rode away.
There were not a few instances, however, of attachments
which ended in marriage, and some of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
non-commissioned officers and men also brought
home Spanish or French wives. These men of
war certainly carried large hearts buttoned within
their tight-fitting coatees, and the cordiality of
the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">entente</i> was beyond dispute, as is evident from
the following words with which one of Napier's
subalterns concludes his account of the war<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a>&mdash;words
which, when compared with the above-quoted
paragraph, show with what different eyes
a bachelor lieutenant and a married lieutenant-colonel
looked on life:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"But at the conclusion of the war there was
such an abundance of kissing as probably the like
of it was never seen before, which put one in mind
of the adage, 'that none but the brave deserve
the fair.' There was kissing in the valleys, and
kissing upon the hills, and, in short, there was
embracing, kissing, and counter-kissing from
Toulouse to Bordeaux."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">CHAPTER XIII.</a><br />
<span class="center xs">THE WATERLOO CAMPAIGN.</span></h2>

<p class="noindent">Samuel Rice's regimental soldiering so far had
been full of excitement, and he had certainly borne
his share of service abroad and in the field. He
had suffered considerably in health, and had been
invalided on more than one occasion, but his
twenty-one years' service had not been without
reward, although, it may be remarked, he himself
appears to have thought little of his brevet or of
his gold medal. His letters of this time show
that, like many another senior regimental officer,
he considered that he had had enough campaigning
to satisfy him for some years&mdash;if not for his lifetime,&mdash;and
he rejoiced in the idea of a lasting peace
and the quiet of garrison life at home. So convinced
was he that a period of leisure and rest
was in store for him that, confirmed bachelor as he
had hitherto believed himself to be, he seized the
opportunity to get married. Yet, within a very
few months, his dream vanished; for he was
suddenly called upon to leave his bride and go
back to war.</p>

<p>Napoleon was once again the cause of all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
trouble. When he abdicated in April 1814, he
was deported, as a state prisoner, to the Island of
Elba, in the Mediterranean; although, out of
deference to the feelings of so great a man, his
sentence of imprisonment was couched in the most
polite terms: Elba was ceded to him, and there
he was permitted to reside, with a large retinue
and a pension from France. The nations of Europe
hugged themselves with the hope that they had
settled the troubler for all time, but early in March
1815 they received a rude awakening; for Napoleon
was not the man to settle down quietly, at the age
of forty-six, without making an effort to retrieve
his fallen fortunes and recover his lost throne; and
he astonished the world by escaping from Elba,
and landing in the south of France. Here he was
received enthusiastically by the people, and more
especially by his old soldiers, who, again raising
the cry of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Vive l'Empereur!</i> forthwith joined his
standard and marched on Paris, whereupon the
Bourbon king fled, and Napoleon once more defied
all Europe.</p>

<p>By the Treaty of Paris (1814) Napoleon had
agreed for himself and his family to renounce the
throne of France, and the allied Powers had agreed
to evacuate French territory. A congress then
assembled at Vienna to settle various weighty
questions connected with the rearrangement of
frontiers, which Napoleon's high-handed conquests
had upset in all directions. How long this congress
would have sat it is impossible to say; no
two Powers would come to terms on any point
put forward, and as time went on events moved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
towards an open rupture between certain of the
Powers. Napoleon's escape, however, put an end
to all differences, and the nations one and all determined
to combine against the common "enemy
and disturber of the world." The armies of some
of the Powers had not retired far beyond the
frontiers of France, and these turned about and
prepared for an immediate invasion, while those
at a distance began to move up.</p>

<p>Towards the close of 1813 Great Britain had
sent an army, under the command of Sir Thomas
Graham, to the Netherlands (Holland and Belgium),
to assist the Prince of Orange in holding his own
against the French, and the bulk of that army,
still remaining in these countries after the peace
of 1814, formed the nucleus of Wellington's army
of 1815, reinforcements being despatched rapidly
from England.</p>

<p>On the 30th March, the 51st landed at Ostend.
Lieut.-Colonel Rice was in luck again, for he found
himself in command of the regiment, Colonel
Mitchell having been appointed to the command
of a brigade. Travelling in barges on the canal,
the regiment moved through Bruges to Ghent,
where it halted for a few days, and then marched
to Brussels, a week later moving into cantonments
at Grammont.</p>

<p>The command of the Anglo-Dutch or Anglo-Belgian
army was given to Wellington, who soon
assembled, in the Netherlands, some 100,000 troops.
Acting in conjunction with him was the Army of
the Lower Rhine, consisting of Prussians and
Saxons, under Blücher, numbering another 100,000<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
or perhaps a little more. Next came the Austrians
and Bavarians (under Schweidnitz), who, to the
number of 250,000, were known as the Army of
the Upper Rhine; while, away in rear, 170,000
Russians were moving up in reserve. Moreover,
the Spaniards, Portuguese, Swiss, Sardinians,
Danes and Swedes, were all ready to close in on
France, in the event of their co-operation being
required. As a matter of fact, Wellington and
Blücher hewed their road to victory without the
assistance of the others.</p>

<p>Had Wellington had his way, he would have
moved into France and assumed the offensive
before Napoleon should have time to reorganise
his army, but for political and other reasons this
was found to be impossible, and April and May
were spent in making arrangements for the defence
of Belgium; for it was judged that Napoleon would
strike at Brussels as soon as possible. He himself
would have preferred to have bided his time, but
he was forced into immediate action by the
knowledge that, if he were to delay, he would be
overwhelmed by the Austrians and Russians. He
despised the army of Wellington, and he thought
little of the British commander, against whom,
however, he had never as yet been pitted. For
these reasons he was not long in making up his
mind to invade Belgium.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Wellington and Blücher had disposed
their armies so as to watch the approaches to the
Belgian capital, and by the beginning of June the
general situation was as follows: At Brussels
Wellington had his headquarters, and kept Cole's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
and Picton's divisions in reserve. In front, <em>i.e.</em>,
towards the south, Hill's corps was on the right,
stretching from the Scheldt up to about Ath; and
the Prince of Orange's corps at Mons, Enghien,
and Nivelles, prolonged the line to the left; while
the Dutch and Belgian cavalry, covering these two
corps, were posted well out in front, and Lord
Uxbridge's British cavalry was kept in rear, about
Grammont. To the left again came the Prussians,
with the headquarters of their corps at Charleroi,
Namur, Ciney, and Liège. So that the whole line
covered a front of about one hundred miles, and
was, roughly speaking, forty to fifty miles to the
south of Brussels.</p>

<p>The 51st was in the 4th British Brigade (Mitchell),
belonging to the 4th Division (Colville), in
Hill's corps, and the regiment remained in its cantonments
at Grammont until the morning of the
16th June. How little was known up to this time
of the coming campaign is vouched for by a letter
which Colonel Rice wrote at Grammont on the 9th
June, but which was not posted till the 13th. He
wrote as if the army generally had no idea of any
immediate fighting taking place. "We are at
present quiet," he said; "all a matter of conjecture
as to what is to be done. The Great Duke
knows, but we poor devils know nothing."</p>

<p>But at this time even the Great Duke himself
did not know what was going on at any great
distance beyond his outposts. Up to the 12th
June he had not heard that the French were
actually moving towards the Belgian frontier,
though he may have suspected it; and so badly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
served was he by his intelligence officers (who, it
is only fair to say, were themselves kept in ignorance
of events by the Prussian staff), that it was
not until the afternoon of the 15th that he was
able to decide whether Napoleon intended to advance
on Brussels in one column, by the direct
road <em>viâ</em> Charleroi, or whether he would divide his
force so as to send a portion of it by the western
route through Mons and Hal. Meanwhile Napoleon,
with his customary energy, had matured
his plans rapidly, and had pushed forward his
several corps towards the frontier; so that, when
he himself left Paris on the 12th June, he had
made up his mind that he would cross into Belgium
on the 15th, and be in possession of Brussels
shortly afterwards, having defeated Blücher's
Prussians and Wellington's British and allied
troops. He concentrated rapidly, and on the
night of the 14th nearly the whole of his army
was in bivouac close up to the Prussian outposts.
At dawn on the 15th he saw the first item on his
programme carried out, the French forcing back
the Prussians, occupying Charleroi, and advancing
northwards towards Quatre Bras.</p>

<p>At 3 <span class="xs">P.M.</span> that day Wellington was apprised of
these movements, but so certain was he of the
soundness of his dispositions that he feared
nothing. Learning that no French troops were
moving in the direction of Mons, he knew that his
right flank was safe, so at 5 <span class="xs">P.M.</span> he issued orders
for a general concentration of his force towards
Quatre Bras&mdash;the point where the Nivelles-Ligny
road crossed the road from Charleroi to Brussels&mdash;and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
at 10 <span class="xs">P.M.</span> he supplemented these orders by
detailed instructions as to routes and objectives.
Then he attended the famous ball given by the
Duchess of Richmond in Brussels, whereat a great
many British officers were present, though all had
been warned that they were to leave early and join
their regiments marching to the front. Straight
from the festive scene, therefore, many rode all
night to overtake the troops only as they were
becoming engaged with the enemy.</p>

<p>At daybreak on the 16th the 51st (with Mitchell's
brigade) left Grammont for Braine le Comte,
where, after a weary march, it halted for the night
in pouring rain. During the march the sounds of
guns were distinctly heard in the distance, yet no
one in the regiment knew what was taking place,
or the whereabouts of the enemy. But not far
away stirring events had been in progress. At
11 <span class="xs">A.M.</span> Wellington, riding from Brussels, had
reached the position which his advanced troops
were taking up at Quatre Bras, though by that
time only some 7000 Dutch and Belgians, under
the Prince of Orange, had arrived. Fortunately,
however, Napoleon appeared to be directing all
his energies against Blücher's 80,000 Prussians,
in the neighbourhood of Ligny, and Wellington
rode across to confer with the Prussian Field-Marshal,
eventually agreeing to go to his assistance at
4 <span class="xs">P.M.</span>, if not himself attacked.</p>

<p>Wellington then returned to Quatre Bras, and
within a couple of hours realised that the Prussians
would have to look after themselves; for Napoleon,
aiming at a double victory, sent Ney against Wel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>lington
early in the afternoon, and the battle
which raged around Quatre Bras for the remainder
of the day only ended in a victory for Wellington
by the timely arrival of the reserves from Brussels.
Blücher, in the meanwhile, had been severely
handled by Napoleon, who, after a bloody conflict
of nearly six hours, succeeded in breaking the
centre of the Prussian line and driving the defeated
army from the field. But of the forced
retreat of his Prussian allies from Ligny Wellington
heard nothing definite until next morning,
when he learned that Blücher had retired upon
Wavre.</p>

<p>No sooner did Wellington become aware of the
Prussian retreat than he decided to fall back from
Quatre Bras to the position at Waterloo which he
had had in his mind all along, and at about 10 <span class="xs">A.M.</span>
on the 17th June he sent word to Blücher that he
would fight at Waterloo if a Prussian corps would
join him there. He then issued orders for the
retirement from Quatre Bras, and sent instructions
to Prince Frederic's Dutch-Belgians and such
troops of the 4th Division as were at Braine le
Comte or on the road to Nivelles to assemble at
the former of these two places and await orders,
while all other troops were to retire at once to
Waterloo. Now it happened that Mitchell's
brigade alone of the 4th Division, marching early
from Braine le Comte, had reached Nivelles before
the order arrived, and thus avoided sharing in the
ill-luck which befell the remainder of the division&mdash;viz.,
being posted on the flank at Tubize, near
Hal, while the great victory of the 18th June was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
being won.<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> Mitchell, therefore, paraded his
brigade with the 2nd Division, already at Nivelles;
and at noon the 51st was marching north by the
Brussels road.</p>

<p>The march of the afternoon was hot and dusty,
and was made all the more disagreeable by the
road frequently becoming blocked by troops, guns,
wagons, and ambulances withdrawing from Quatre
Bras. The prospects of a fight, however, kept the
men going, and the sight of some French columns
in motion during the afternoon put new life into
them. It was evident that an engagement could
not be long delayed, and many imagined that it
would take place before nightfall. Towards evening
Mitchell marched his brigade on to that part
of the position allotted to it&mdash;on the extreme right
near Braine la Leud, and there the 51st and the
other regiments of the brigade bivouacked. In
all directions troops could be seen moving into
position; and though darkness was approaching it
still seemed as if the fight could not be postponed
till the morrow. Masses of French troops were
visible at no great distance, and a few British
guns were already opening fire on some of the
enemy's infantry, while parties of cavalry were
briskly engaged in more than one part of the
field.</p>

<p>But the night closed in without matters going<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
further, and it was a night not easily forgotten by
those who slept out in it. Rain fell in torrents,
so that the bivouacs became a sea of mud, and the
soldiers, lying out in the open, were drenched to
the skin. When at length day broke and the
heavy rain ceased, the situation became fully
apparent, and no doubt remained as to the severity
of the coming struggle. Less than a mile
separated the two great armies, drawn up and
facing one another. Between them lay a shallow
valley, some two or three miles in length, and
averaging half a mile in width, the sides sloping
gently, but being everywhere uneven and undulating.
The trend of the valley was east and
west, and Wellington's army occupied the northern
crest and ground in rear, slightly in advance of
the village of Mont St Jean; while the French
were in position on the southern crest. From
south to north, and dividing each position into
two almost equal parts, ran the great paved causeway
from Charleroi to Brussels. Such was the
field whereon was fought the memorable battle of
Waterloo, so named from the village a little in
rear of Mont St Jean; and within that cramped
area there were at one time engaged no fewer than
one hundred and eighty thousand combatants.</p>

<p>It is not proposed to treat here of the battle of
Waterloo in detail&mdash;a task to which numerous
bulky volumes have been devoted,&mdash;but in describing
the small part played in the fight by Lieut.-Colonel
Sam Rice and his regiment, it will be
necessary at any rate to sum up the situation at
various times, in order to make the narrative com<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>plete.
Still it may be said at once that the bulk
of Mitchell's brigade kept to the one part of the
field throughout the day, at times gaining ground,
at times forced back, yet ever awaiting attack in
the vicinity of Hougoumont. The brigade was
weak in numbers, mustering no more than 1800
bayonets, of which the 51st supplied 540. The
duty allotted to Mitchell was an important one,
since Wellington considered it probable that Napoleon
would attempt to turn his right flank and
push through to Brussels by way of the road
through Hal, and it was for that reason that he
had detached the Dutch-Belgians and part of the
4th Division (numbering in all some 18,000 men)
to the neighbourhood of Hal. These troops were
some five miles from the field of battle, and at the
outset Mitchell's brigade was called upon to hold
in check any determined movement of the enemy
in this direction until fresh dispositions could be
made.</p>

<p>Wellington had taken up a strong defensive
position, with most of his troops drawn back below
the actual crest, and with his reserves well concealed
by the folds of the ground. Napoleon, on
the other hand, deigned to little concealment, and
sought to break down his opponents' defences by
sheer weight of numbers. At a little before noon
the fight commenced, Napoleon sending forward
his brother, Prince Jerome, against the advanced
post of Hougoumont, which, as the key of the
position, was strongly held by the Allies. At the
same time an artillery duel opened all along the
line, and a tempest of shot and shell raged across<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
the valley; but the defenders of Hougoumont,
reinforced by the whole of Byng's British Guards,
resisted every onslaught of the French columns,
even though parties of the enemy established
themselves close up to the buildings and set them
on fire. Almost continuously during the afternoon
the attacks on this vital point went on, and so
numerous at times were the assailants that they
were able to overlap it and threaten the right of
the Allies' main line. Here Mitchell's men came
into action, and assisted in forcing back the
assailants.</p>

<p>Early in the day Mitchell had advanced several
companies, for the purpose of closing the gap
between Hougoumont and Braine la Leud, and
one company of the 51st was posted close to an
abatis which had been placed across the main
road a little in rear of the entrance to the avenue
of Hougoumont. Four other companies of the
regiment were extended farther to the right,
along the hollow way leading to Braine la Leud,
with instructions to engage the enemy's skirmishers
as they advanced, and then to endeavour
to harass with heavy musket fire the solid columns
following their skirmishers. As had been expected,
the French columns came on, covered by skirmishers,
but so advantageous was the ground over
which they advanced, and so high the standing
corn through which they moved, that the companies
of the 51st could not observe their approach
until they were almost upon them. Then, rising,
the British soldiers poured in their fire at forty
paces, and, cheering wildly, dashed forward at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
charge. And the impetuous onslaught had the
desired effect, for the enemy, although supported
by cavalry, were beaten back. The four companies
of the 51st were then ordered to retire some two
hundred yards, and rejoin the regiment.</p>

<p>While this was in progress, Napoleon was busy
making preparations for his grand assault, designed
to break the left centre of the British position.
For this great effort, seventy-four guns were moved
up, so as to bring their fire to bear, at a range of
less than half a mile, on the Allies; and Marshal
Ney was placed in command of 18,000 men in four
columns, supported by Kellerman's cavalry division.
Napoleon hoped that this combined attack would
be final and decisive; that, having captured the
advanced post of La Haie Sainte, the columns
would be able to sweep onwards to Mont St Jean,
cut off Wellington from Brussels as well as from
the Prussians coming from the direction of Wavre,
and thus make victory complete. At 1 <span class="xs">P.M.</span> Ney's
masses of columns moved down into the valley,
and passed the seventy-four guns, which immediately
opened fire over their heads, and caused
havoc in the ranks of the Allies. Three of the
columns pressed forward towards the Allies' centre,
while the third moved away north-east, with the
intention of driving in the left flank. Whether by
design or by accident, Ney's principal attack was
directed against the portion of the front line held
by Bylandt's brigade of Dutch and Belgians, and
no sooner did the French skirmishers, covering the
advance of the columns, begin to make use of their
muskets than panic seized their adversaries, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
turned and fled in disorder. Then was Wellington's
forethought, as well as the wisdom of his
dispositions, apparent, for doubting the loyalty of
the Dutch-Belgians, he had been careful to support
them everywhere by British brigades, and here,
close in rear, stood Picton's division, ready to
take the place of the disloyal or cowardly Dutch-Belgians.</p>

<p>Although barely recovered from the effects of
their recent fighting at Quatre Bras, Picton's 3000
gallant men responded to the call, and advanced
in two thin lines to meet the 12,000 Frenchmen,
already flushed with victory. Nearer the columns
approached, and the British lines halted to receive
them. Then, when within a few yards, Ney
ordered his columns to deploy into line, Picton,
taking advantage of the momentary check, delivered
a withering volley and then charged in
with the bayonet. The head of the leading French
column was hurled back in confusion, and the
3000 British soldiers flung themselves upon the
disorganised 12,000 Frenchmen, before they could
recover from their first surprise. Picton was shot
dead as he led the charge, but his gallant action
had saved the situation, and it remained for the
cavalry to complete Ney's discomfiture in this
part of the field, charging the broken infantry,
overthrowing the cavalry, and putting the seventy-four
guns out of action for the remainder of the
day.</p>

<p>Thus ended the second phase of the great battle,
and so far Napoleon had made no headway. Yet
he was by no means disheartened, and, ordering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
all his remaining guns into action, he pounded the
British line from a distance, while he prepared for
his next assault. At 4 <span class="xs">P.M.</span> began another phase
of the fight, when Wellington's right wing was
assailed by squadron after squadron of Cuirassiers,
fresh bodies of infantry moving at the same time
against La Haie Sainte and Hougoumont. The
charges of the French cavalry were magnificent,
but the squares in which Wellington had rapidly
formed his troops resisted all the enemy's efforts
to break them. The British guns also stood firm,
firing grape at the charging horsemen, until they
arrived within forty yards, when, discharging a
salvo, the gunners quitted their guns for the time
being and fell back to the shelter of the infantry
squares. Four times did the French cavalry
charge home, using some 12,000 men for the
purpose; yet were they able to do no more than
to ride round and between the squares, which,
being arranged chequerwise, met them with bristling
bayonets and a rattling musketry fire in all
directions, throwing them into disorder and obliging
the greater number to draw off, with heavy
losses in killed, wounded, and prisoners.</p>

<p>It was just before this that the company of the
51st, still posted near the abatis on the Nivelles
road, was able to do some execution. A party of
Cuirassiers, captured by the British cavalry after
riding into the position, broke away from their
escort and endeavoured to make their way back
to their own lines. Galloping down the Nivelles
road, hotly pursued by the escort, they first came
under fire of a detachment of the 51st, out in front<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
of the regiment; but from this fire they suffered
little, as it became masked by the pursuing British
dragoons. The sound of the firing in his rear,
however, attracted the attention of Captain Ross,
commanding the 51st company near the abatis,
and he soon became aware of the approach of the
fugitives, who, ignorant of the fact that the road
was blocked, came on at full speed. Then Ross
turned his men about, and, opening fire, emptied
many saddles. "Eight of the Cuirassiers," says
Siborne, the historian, "and twelve of their horses,
were killed, and the remainder, about sixty, taken
or dispersed."</p>

<p>The greater part of Napoleon's famous heavy
cavalry was now <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">hors de combat</i>, and had effected
little, except that perhaps their several charges
had helped Donzelot's infantry to gain a footing
in the vicinity of La Haie Sainte, and thus enabled
them, a little later, to capture that post. This
success to be of any value Napoleon realised would
have to be followed up forthwith, for he was
already aware that the Prussians from Wavre
were approaching his right flank. It was past
seven o'clock in the evening, and there was no
time to lose; consequently, Napoleon bestirred
himself, and prepared for his final grand assault
on Wellington's position. The capture of La Haie
Sainte proved of great value to the Frenchmen,
for Donzelot's men were able to prevent, with their
musketry fire, the British gunners in their front
from fighting their guns. French guns were then
brought up to the post, and at a range of less
than a hundred yards, poured grape into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
ranks of the Allies. Napoleon felt confident that
victory was within his grasp; his grand reserve&mdash;his
veterans of the Old Guard&mdash;still remained
at hand, fresh and ready for a supreme effort,
and he determined that they should make that
effort. Placing Ney in command of the two
massive columns of infantry, he ordered them to
take a line between La Haie Sainte and Hougoumont,
and assail the position. As his beloved
veterans passed him on the way to the front, he
sat on his white horse with outstretched arm,
pointing in the direction which the attack was to
take, and the cheers which came from the old
soldiers convinced him that if it were possible at
this juncture for any troops to break down Wellington's
defences, then his Imperial Guard would
do it.</p>

<p>Down the slope in front of La Belle Alliance,
into the shallow valley marched these 10,000
warriors, headed by the drummers beating the
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pas de charge</i>.<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> Then, as they began to ascend
towards the British position, they pushed forward
a cloud of skirmishers, who, joining hands with
those of Donzelot, opened a heavy fire. The two
columns, advancing to the attack in close order,
were now seen to be heading straight for that
part of the line held by Maitland's brigade of
Guards. On the right of Maitland, Adam's
brigade had been moved up, so as to prolong the
line as far as the northern enclosure of Hougoumont,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
to the right rear of which, again, stood
Mitchell's brigade, in support of the gallant garrison
of the château.</p>

<p>Barely four hundred yards separated the head
of the leading French column from the British
position, when Sir John Colborne, commanding
the 52nd, of Adam's brigade, swiftly realised the
situation. Acting on his own initiative, he gave
the order to his regiment to advance in quick time
towards the flank of the attacking columns, and
the long red line moved forward in perfect order.
Then suddenly he wheeled his whole line up, so
as to face the flank of the columns, and threw out
a company of skirmishers with orders to open fire
on the Imperial Guard. The Frenchmen, thus
challenged, halted and replied, and by so doing
brought destruction upon themselves, for Colborne's
line was ready for them. The ranks closed
up; the bugles rang out; and with one mighty
roar from the regiment, eight hundred British
bayonets bore down on the veterans of France.
But the latter did not stand to receive the charge;
the sudden onslaught appalled them; the leading
battalions broke and fled to the rear, and in their
flight carried with them the whole of the Imperial
Guard&mdash;the flower of the French army, and
Napoleon's last hope. No time was given to
them to re-form, for the remainder of Adam's
brigade and Maitland's Guards opened fire upon
them from the higher ground as they fled; and
Wellington, with the light of victory in his eyes,
ordered a general advance towards La Belle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
Alliance, where Napoleon and Ney could be seen
rallying their men for a last stand.</p>

<p>But when, as the sun fast approached the
horizon, Blücher's Prussians were observed to be
moving in rapidly from the east and north-east,
the French knew that the squares into which they
had been hastily formed would be powerless to
stem the tide of the advancing hosts. One man
alone amongst them all remained resolute. Napoleon
even then refused to acknowledge himself
beaten, and enjoined on his soldiers to stand firm,
and, if necessary, die by his side on the field. His
generals, however, saw that all hope had gone, and
begged their emperor to make good his escape
while there was yet time. Then, as the squares
gave way and melted into the great mass of fugitives
pressing south, Soult and the others rode off
with their mighty leader&mdash;away from his last field
of battle. In Wellington, the "Sepoy-General"
at whom he had scoffed, Napoleon had met his
match.</p>

<p>The pursuit did not slacken for an instant, and
Wellington led on his victorious troops as far as
Rossomme, when, assured that victory was complete
and that the Prussians were following on
the heels of the flying Frenchmen, he drew rein,
and in the moonlight rode back towards Waterloo.
At Genappe he met Marshal Blücher; and, amidst
the cheers of those around them, the two great
warriors gripped hands, as they congratulated each
other on the brilliant result of the battle. Then it
was arranged that the Prussians should continue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
the pursuit; while the British army, worn out by
nine hours' hard fighting, bivouacked on the actual
battlefield.</p>

<p>The 51st and the 14th lay on their arms for
the night in the wood of Hougoumont; the 23rd,
having taken part in the general advance, bivouacked
near La Belle Alliance; and next morning
Mitchell's three regiments, having united again,
marched to Nivelles, where they halted for a day
to get rations, and were congratulated, in special
orders issued by Lord Hill and by Sir Charles
Colville, on the part that they had played in
"the glorious and for ever memorable battle of
the 18th June." For their share in this victory
both Colonel Mitchell and Lieutenant-Colonel Rice
were appointed Companions of the Bath. Thus
once again fortune smiled on Samuel Rice, who,
until the autumn of 1813, had considered himself
the most unlucky of officers. A stroke of luck, as
has been shown, gave him the temporary command
of the 51st at the battle of the Nivelle, the
Peninsular Gold Medal, and a brevet lieutenant-colonelcy;
by luck he obtained the temporary
command of the regiment at Waterloo, the
Waterloo Medal, and the C.B., as well as the
sum of £433, being a field-officer's share of the
prize-money granted by Parliament to the victorious
army. And by pure and simple luck alone
did the 51st take part in the great battle, instead
of being at Tubize with the rest of the 4th
Division. Moreover, all this led subsequently to
Colonel Rice receiving the further honour of being
appointed a Knight of Hanover. Yet there are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
some who maintain that there is no such thing as
luck. Without it, Colonel Rice would have missed
four decorations&mdash;in an age when decorations were
not freely given; and without it, he would have
gone to his grave unrewarded for his many campaigns,
for the Silver Medal for the Peninsular
War was not granted until eight years after his
death. The services rendered by himself and his
regiment at Waterloo may not have been very
remarkable, though it is certain that they did all
that was required of them.</p>

<p>Some years afterwards, when Captain William
Siborne was constructing his famous model of
Waterloo, now in the Museum of the R.U.S. Institution,
Colonel Rice, among other survivors of the
battle, was requested to describe the movements
of the regiment which he commanded on that
eventful day. His reply<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> was characteristic of
the man: he claimed no honour or glory for
himself, but he set forth the bald facts:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The 51st Regiment was in the Corps of the
Army immediately under Lord Hill&mdash;brigaded
with the 14th and 23rd, under the command of
Colonel Mitchell, being a Light Corps, and standing
at the head of the column upon its first
formation at the crest of the position. Companies
were in succession ordered in front, and occupied
ground to the right of the Nivelles road, pretty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
nearly in line with the Hougoumont farm. Lastly,
the remaining companies under my command
descended and took possession of a favourable
rising ground, covered with thick brushwood, and
very defensible against any sudden attack of cavalry.
Here we remained posted, waiting orders.</p>

<p>"Late in the day, I forget the hour, an aide-de-camp
from Lord Hill came down with an order
to keep <em>this ground</em> to the <em>last</em>, as he was withdrawing
his whole force to the left, and that I
must not expect <em>any support</em>. Consequently I
prepared myself to render as defensible as possible
the post committed to my charge.</p>

<p>"Being so separated from the army, you will
perceive we bore no decided part in the action,
and were but holding ground during the great
movements. The French had a line of cavalry&mdash;vedettes&mdash;in
our front; and to their rear, at a
considerable distance, I could perceive a body of
lancers, who no doubt were waiting some favourable
moment to advance.</p>

<p>"Situated as I was, I could see but little of
what was going on to my left, except the charge of
the French cuirassiers, on the left of Hougoumont
farm, on the position. After being foiled in this
attempt against the squares, a considerable body
passed down the Nivelles road, on which there
was an <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">abatis</i>. I was so placed as to perceive
this, and gave my parties in advance orders to
fire, for being so much in their rear, I could not
well distinguish friend from foe. The fire was
successful, though some few miraculously cleared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">abatis</i>. I mention this merely to show our
ground more than anything else.</p>

<p>"What I have offered I fear you will not
consider very satisfactory, but you must remember
we were not connected during any part of the
memorable day with any of the principal movements.
In fact, I have considered my regiment
as a picket detached from the main body, throwing
out skirmishers and supports, according to
my own view, and in covering a certain space of
ground.</p>

<p>"I have been frequently questioned respecting
the battle of Waterloo and movements, and my
reply has invariably been that I was so situated
as to have but a partial view of the field, and
not engaged in the great conflict that was raging
to my left. In fact, I may say that I was
stationary throughout the day, and the only order
I received was the one I have already mentioned.&mdash;I

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">CHAPTER XIV.</a><br />
<span class="center xs">PARIS&mdash;AND PEACE.</span></h2>

<p class="noindent">To capture the French capital as rapidly as
possible, and before Napoleon should have an
opportunity of rallying his defeated army, now
became the object of the allied forces. On the
20th June the Prussians had passed the frontier
in hot pursuit of the fugitive Frenchmen, and by
the 23rd Blücher was at Catillon and Wellington
at Le Cateau Cambresis. Meanwhile, the French
had begun to recover from their panic, and twenty
thousand had assembled at Laon, where Soult
was working strenuously to get them into order,
hoping that when Grouchy arrived with his
corps it would be possible to do something to
check the advance of the Allies. After Ligny,
Grouchy had pursued the beaten Prussians towards
Wavre, where he defeated their rearguard on the
18th and 19th June. Then, retreating, he beat
off an attack by Pirch at Namur on the 20th, and
withdrew into France. Wellington and Blücher
were aware of all this, and debated whether to
turn aside and attack Soult forthwith, or whether
to pass him by and push on to Paris. They
decided on the latter course.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span></p>

<p>From the Belgian frontier four principal roads
converged on Paris. On the easternmost road
the French were collecting at Laon, while scattered
fugitives, making for the capital, were
pressing along the other three roads, of which
the two on the west were allotted to Wellington's
columns and the third to Blücher's troops. On
the 24th June Mitchell's brigade, which had
marched from Nivelles to Le Cateau, received
orders to proceed to Cambray, which was still
held by a French garrison. The reduction of the
place was entrusted to Colville's division, and
the garrison was summoned that night, but refused
to surrender. Next morning Colville ordered the
assault of the works, detailing the light companies
of Johnstone's brigade to storm the Valencienne
gate, while the 23rd and 51st simultaneously
assaulted the Paris gate. The two regiments
succeeded in breaking open the outer gate of
the Couvre Port with little difficulty, but the
Paris gate itself resisted every effort. Close by,
however, there was found a breach in the walls
under repair, and by storming this an entry was
effected, without much loss&mdash;the 51st having no
more than two men killed and ten wounded.
The Valencienne gate was carried by Johnstone's
brigade, and the garrison withdrew to the citadel,
which held out until the evening of the 25th.</p>

<p>The advance on Paris was then resumed;
Peronne was captured by the Guards division
and Ham by the Prussians; and a few days later
Soult and Grouchy, retreating towards Paris, made
a feeble attempt to cut in on Blücher's flank, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
failing to make any impression continued the
march to the capital, which they reached on
the 29th June. Napoleon himself had arrived
there on the 21st, but had been forced by
the Chamber of Deputies to abdicate, and had
then retired to Malmaison, a few miles out of
Paris.</p>

<p>On the 29th Blücher was at Gonesse, with his
advanced troops close to Aubervilliers, near St
Denis; and Wellington was at Senlis. Although
the Chamber had asked for a suspension of hostilities,
no agreement had been arrived at, and knowing
that the French now had some 80,000 soldiers
in Paris, Wellington and Blücher decided that the
Prussians should move round to the south of the
city, while the remainder of the allied troops
pushed in from the north. On the 30th, therefore,
the Prussians crossed the Seine near St Germains,
and two days later Blücher was at Versailles. On
that day (July 2) Wellington threw a bridge
across the Seine at Argenteuil, to better his communications
with Blücher, and on the following
day the last shots of the campaign were fired, the
Prussians having a smart skirmish at Issy, and the
opposing piquets on the north of the city exchanging
a few shots. In the evening part of the 51st
moved to the village of Aubervilliers, which had
not been wholly abandoned by the French troops, so
that, as had frequently occurred in Peninsula times,
one half of the village was held by the British and
the other by the French, without molesting one
another. And here occurred one of those curious
incidents illustrative of the friendship of enemies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
which were not uncommon in Peninsular warfare.
Ensign Mainwaring tells the story:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"We soon grew friends, and on the full security
of honourable warfare some of us crossed the
streets and entered into conversation with the
officers. They good-naturedly asked us how we
were off for eatables, and offered to send us some
white bread and tobacco; and the nearest picket
was immediately furnished with a good supply, for
which their sutler-woman was well paid, though
the French refused at first to take payment. They
asked us into the house and gave us an excellent
luncheon, and whilst we were all laughing and
talking away, one of the officers, by his epaulettes
apparently a major, took hold of the button of my
jacket, and looking at it exclaimed, 'Ah, 51st!
Was monsieur with his regiment in Spain? for I
saved the life of one of your captains, whom we
captured at the battle of Nivelle; he was <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">un brave
homme, bel homme</i>. Is he alive? I should so
much like to see him.' It was rather singular
that the person of whom he spoke was the captain
of my company (Phelps),<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> and I accordingly told
the Frenchman that his wish could be instantly
and easily gratified, that the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Brave</i> was in a house
not a hundred yards distant, and I immediately
sent for him. He soon came; the Gaul was
delighted, flew into his arms, kissed him on one
cheek and then on the other, talked with the
utmost rapidity, asked a hundred questions and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
never waited for one answer from my gallant old
chief, who, when he got breathing-time, recognised
him instantly, shook him heartily by the hand,
acknowledged that he had saved his life, prevented
his being plundered or ill-used, and that he behaved
in the kindest and most generous manner
possible to him.<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> No one who saw us all clustered
together in this friendly manner, amongst these
mustachioed veterans of Napoleon, would ever
have imagined that we were foes, and that perhaps
in a short half hour we might be seeking each
other's lives, with bayonets clashing and bullets
whizzing from those hands so cordially grasped in
kind and grateful feeling without one spark of
national hate or animosity between us."</p>
</div>

<p>In all probability, although young Mainwaring
was not in the secret, the senior officers on both
sides had an inkling that the campaign was over,
for, earlier in the day, an agreement to suspend
hostilities had been negotiated at St Cloud. This
was known as the "Convention of Paris," by the
provisions of which the French army was to be
withdrawn to the south of the river Loire within
eight days, and Paris to be handed over to the
Allies. During the two following days the French
troops marched out of the capital, and the Allies
encamped in the Bois de Boulogne, the occupation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
of the actual city being completed on the 7th July,
on which day Adam's brigade made a triumphant
entry and pitched camp in the Champs Elysées.
Thus within three weeks of the firing of the first
shot of the campaign Napoleon had been crushed,
his capital captured, and Louis XVIII. restored to
the throne.</p>

<p>The fate of the greatest Frenchman who ever
lived was certainly pitiable, yet for the peace of
Europe it was impossible to allow him liberty.
From Paris he fled to Rochefort on the 2nd July,
hoping to escape to America, but discovering that
the Bourbons were about to arrest him, he
surrendered to Captain Maitland of H.M.S.
<i>Bellerophon</i>, and was at once conveyed to Plymouth.
Here he made the bold request to be
permitted to reside in England, as a country
gentleman, on his parole; but the allied Powers
refused his request, and politely intimated to him
their decision that the remainder of his life should
be spent at St Helena. There, accordingly, he
lived, in open arrest, until the end came on the
5th May 1821.</p>

<p>Paris was the second European capital into
which Samuel Rice and the 51st, as part of a
triumphant army, had marched within the past
three years, and as all chance of further fighting
was at an end, they thoroughly enjoyed the life
which they led for the next few weeks. Great
numbers of English people visited Paris, to see
their relations and friends in the army of occupation,
and as the Parisians themselves were both
friendly and hospitable, there was no lack of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
amusement. There were, of course, plenty of
guards to be found and other duties to be
performed, the most interesting of which, perhaps,
were in connection with the removal of art
treasures from the Louvre. For many years
Napoleon and his victorious generals had made
it a custom to bring back as spoils of war
the choicest paintings and statues to be found
in the museums of conquered countries, and to
place them in the Louvre, to become heirlooms
for the French nation. Now, however, that the
Allies were masters of the situation, they decided
to restore all these things to their rightful owners,
and the various regiments furnished working
parties, to assist in packing up the treasures, as
well as guards, to prevent possible French interference,
for many days in succession. Curiously
enough, the Parisians paid very little attention to
what was going on, and the removal of everything
that was claimed by foreign nations was effected
without trouble.</p>

<p>Gay times the British subaltern had in Paris,
with dances, dinners, and theatres galore, and
many a one lost everything he possessed at the
gaming tables. Yet the young officer cared little
for his losses, and the Frenchmen wanted every
scrap of British gold that they could collect, since
they were called upon to pay a war indemnity of
thirty million pounds for espousing the cause of
Napoleon and defying all Europe.</p>

<p>Until the 30th October, the 51st remained encamped
in the Bois de Boulogne, and then moved
to the village of Verrieres, some ten miles from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
Paris, five weeks later receiving orders to march
to Calais and embark for England, since the regiment
was not required to form part of the army of
occupation of France. So Samuel Rice returned
from his last campaign, covered with honour and
glory, to rest on his laurels, and to settle down to
the dull monotony of peace-time soldiering&mdash;the
comparison between which and campaigning is
well described in the following words:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Those were spirit-stirring days indeed, and
although it may perhaps be wrong to say so, yet
what has life to offer now that can compare with
them? How tame, how stupid, how insipid, does
all the monotony of the daily routine of drills,
peace-guards, and dress-parades, which now fill up
and fritter away our time, appear to them whose
lives for years were passed in camps, living in the
open air, seeing the glorious sun rise every day, or
watching by the piquet-fires at night the beautiful
stars; their minds elevated by the thought that
they were doing their duty to their country, that
the eyes of all Europe were upon their slightest
movements, their hearts beating with enthusiasm,
as victory followed victory; and if death sometimes
came in the midst of all this, its sting was
scarcely felt, since the soldier's soul winged its
flight to heaven 'mid the roar of cannon, the blaze
of musketry, and the victorious cheers of his
gallant comrades."</p>
</div>

<p>Thus soliloquised Frederick Mainwaring, when,
some years afterwards, he was setting down stray
reminiscences of his fighting days. He was then,
with eighteen years' service, still only a lieutenant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
in the 51st, and a decade of garrison life must
have weighed heavily on him. But his lot was
shared by plenty of other Peninsular and Waterloo
heroes, and amongst them, his commanding officer,
Colonel Rice. Yet Mainwaring was more fortunate
than many of his brother officers, who, when the
reductions consequent on peace took place, were
placed on half pay, and so debarred from even
following the profession to which they had devoted
the best part of their lives.<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> Hundreds of officers
were thus thrown on their own resources, and for
years the country was flooded with half-pay
lieutenants. It was, of course, impossible to retain
the services of all of them, and the Government
cannot be accused of meanness, for the half
pay of the infantry lieutenant was increased very
considerably, and he was allowed to count two
years for Waterloo towards service qualifying for
the higher rate.</p>

<p>The 51st arrived in England in January 1816,
to commence a five years' tour of garrison duty,
being quartered first at Blatchington and then at
Chichester, with a detachment for duty at the
Pavilion, at Brighton. In 1817 it moved to
Chatham, and later in the year to Portsmouth,
Samuel Rice being promoted to the command of
the regiment, on the death of Colonel Mitchell, on
the 20th April. In 1818 the 51st marched from
Portsmouth to Plymouth, and in the following
year moved by sea to Chatham and Sheerness,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
whence company detachments were furnished for
Harwich and for the island of Heligoland.<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> In
1820 the regiment was on the move again, changing
quarters an extraordinary number of times,
and being frequently split up into detachments.
Romford, Brighton, Chichester, Croydon, Woolwich,
Greenwich, Deptford, Bow, Stratford,
Teddington, Twickenham, Isleworth, and Winchester
all provided temporary homes for headquarters
or detachments during the year. Three
months in barracks at Winchester was the longest
resting-time allowed the regiment, for though the
officers had begun to hope that these were to be
their quarters for a year or two, in February 1821
they were ordered to Portsmouth, and, after all
these incessant movements, it came almost as a
relief to them to receive, in April, further orders
to prepare for immediate embarkation for the
Mediterranean.</p>

<p>In spite of its distracting changes of quarters,
the regiment had found time to gather recruits
and to recover from the effects of active service,
so that by 1820 it was up to full strength, and
most favourably reported on by the inspecting
general for "its movements and appearance."
With regard to the latter point, it may be of
interest to remark on the dress of the officers and
soldiers of this time. It will be remembered that
in 1809, when the 51st was made a light infantry
regiment, it received a new uniform, and in this
it fought through the Peninsular War and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
Waterloo campaign, though during the former
strict regulations in the matter of dress were, by
force of circumstances, seldom adhered to. It was
frequently impossible for officers to replenish their
worn-out garments, and at times they presented a
most ragged appearance&mdash;very different from that
in which they are handed down to posterity by
painters of the various battle-scenes. Still, so
much was thought of the smart turn-out of a
regiment even on active service, that it was a
point of honour with both officers and men to
clean up on every possible occasion, and it is on
record that the men who stormed Badajoz spent
the hours previous to the assault in polishing
themselves up, "as if for a review." The light
infantry uniform which should have been worn by
the 51st from 1809 onwards, consisted principally
of a short-tailed, easy-fitting red jacket, white
breeches, black cloth leggings, and shoes, with a
light felt shako (having an oilskin covering for
wet weather) as head-dress. At first the officers
wore cocked hats, but in 1811 these were replaced
by shakos with a green feather in front. Probably
it was found that the breeches and leggings were
difficult to keep in repair, for it is certain that
they soon disappeared in favour of blue-grey cloth
trousers, with short spat-gaiters underneath; and
the officers, who were supposed to wear long boots
(to the knee), took to the trousers also, wearing
leather gaiters over them, if they were able to
obtain them. In the interval between the Peninsular
War and the Waterloo campaign regiments
had time to return to a strict uniformity of dress,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
and the grey trousers became the regulation covering
for the legs on active service; otherwise there
was no change until after Waterloo.</p>

<p>As soon as peace was established and regiments
began to return home, the military tailors, who had
had idle times for some years, cast about for openings
for innovations; but since the army had now
established the fact that it was intended for fighting
more than for show, and since the uniform
worn in 1815 was considered both serviceable and
showy, the tailors found some difficulty in introducing
alterations. The opportunity came, however,
in 1816, when some one took a fancy to the
head-dresses worn by some of the foreign troops
forming part of the army of occupation of France,
and forthwith a new shako was designed for the
British army. This was heavy and cumbersome,
being seven and a half inches high and eleven
inches in diameter at the top, but its shape and
size gave the tailors wide scope for lace and other
adornments. So appearance, not for the first
or the last time, was made to override utility.
Other innovations in dress soon followed, and by
1821 the uniform in which the 51st had fought in
the Peninsula and at Waterloo was almost entirely
altered. The grey trousers had gone, and
the white breeches and black leggings had come
back; the curved light infantry sabre, worn by
the officers suspended from slings, was replaced by
a straight sword, hung in a frog from the white
shoulder-belt; and for the short-tailed light infantry
jacket there had been substituted the long-tailed
coatee. The 51st still wore grass-green<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
facings, but in April 1821 his Majesty conferred
upon the regiment the additional title of "The
King's Own Light Infantry," when its facings
were changed to blue and the lace to gold (oak-leaf
pattern). A year later the historic breeches
and leggings finally disappeared, and trousers,
grey or white according to the season, were ordered
to be worn.</p>

<p>In May 1821 the 51st, six hundred and fifty
strong, embarked at Portsmouth for the Ionian
Isles, and reaching Corfu in the following month,
occupied the Citadel and Fort Neuf. It was just
twenty-four years since Samuel Rice and the regiment
had arrived at Gibraltar from Elba, when
the general scuttle from the Mediterranean had
taken place, but in those twenty-four years Great
Britain had established a firm footing in that sea,
having taken and retained possession of Malta
(1800) and the Ionian Isles (1809), and having at
different times occupied, but subsequently evacuated,
Minorca, Sicily, and Alexandria. The Ionian
Isles, in which the 51st remained for thirteen long
years, were seven in number&mdash;viz., Corfu, Cephalonia,
Zante, Ithaca, Santa Maura, Cerigo, and
Paxo&mdash;and, though essentially Greek, had been
under Neapolitan and Venetian rule previous to
being ceded to France in 1797. In 1801 they
were formed into a republic (The Septinsular Republic)
under the protection of Turkey and Russia,
but only to pass again to France in 1807. Collingwood
captured Cephalonia, Zante, Santa Maura,
and Ithaca in 1809, and by the Treaty of Paris
(1815) all seven islands became a British Protec<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>torate,
remaining such until 1863, when they were
transferred to Greece. As a foreign station for
British troops the islands were always most popular,
at any rate with the officers, the climate being
good and the shooting excellent.</p>

<p>Probably no officer was better acquainted with
the Ionian Islands than was Colonel Samuel Rice,
for during the last ten years of his command of
the 51st the regiment furnished detachments at
different times to all the islands, and the colonel
transferred his headquarters from one to another,
though residing principally at Cephalonia, Zante,
and Corfu. Life there was devoid of all excitement,
except, perhaps, that afforded by the wrangling
between the High Commissioner of the Islands,
Sir Frederick Adam (of Adam's brigade of Waterloo
fame), and the British Resident of Cephalonia,
Charles Napier, the eventual conqueror of Sind;
but Rice's twenty odd years of campaigning had
left him none too strong, and he was apparently content
to finish out his regimental service by devoting
himself to the welfare of the corps of which he
was so justly proud. That under his command
the 51st retained its high reputation there is ample
proof in the reports made by various inspecting
generals; and when he gave up the command, in
July 1831, he had the satisfaction of feeling that,
as the last officer of the 51st who had served in
it under Sir John Moore, he had carried out the
teachings of his illustrious chief for thirty-eight
years, and handed the regiment over to his successor
not only in as good a state as he had found
it on joining as an ensign in 1793, but also with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
added laurels which, moreover, he himself had
helped to win.</p>

<p>During the period of Samuel Rice's regimental
service the 51st was abroad for no less than thirty
years; but those were strenuous times, and no
regiment could count on a lengthy sojourn at
home, for, in addition to the long war in Europe,
Great Britain was kept busily engaged in the
East Indies, in the West Indies, and in America.
Still it was exceptional even then for a regiment
to be so continuously on foreign service, but in
this respect, it may be remarked, the 51st was
always exceptional. Apart from the campaigning,
and apart from the bad climate of foreign stations,
the life of the regimental officer was ever without
rest, for the slight repose which might have come
with service at home was broken into by the
authorities, who seem to have been at pains to
deny a resting-place to a regiment for more than
a few months at a time. Yet we people of to-day
find fault with the unfortunate officer of a century
ago, because he did not read military history and
study the theory of his profession! There can be
little doubt, however, that the effect of all this
harassing service was to wear out the officer before
his time. Some veterans there were, of course,
who, being particularly robust, lived to a ripe old
age, but the majority of those officers who fought
for England in the great struggle from 1793 to
1815 passed away long before attaining the allotted
span of three-score years and ten. And Samuel
Rice was one of these.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span></p>

<p>Under the usual purchase system arrangements,
a purse was made up to induce Colonel Rice to
vacate the command of the regiment, but, hoping
for further employment, he exchanged to the half-pay
unattached list. Having no son of his own to
carry on his name in the 51st, he did his best to
make amends by getting two of his three Rice
nephews<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> appointed to the regiment, thus prolonging
the family connection with it for a further
period of twenty-three years. He remained on
half pay until 1834, when he was appointed Inspecting
Field Officer of the Leeds Recruiting
District, an appointment, however, which he held
for only a little more than a year, as his health
gave way and obliged him to lay down his sword.
He died in London on the 7th March 1840, in his
sixty-fifth year, leaving a widow and a daughter.<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a></p>

<p>Such was the career of a typical regimental
officer of the old school, who served his country
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>throughout, perhaps, the most critical period
of its existence, who witnessed the rise and fall
of England's inveterate enemy, who shared in
the victories which won for England fame, and
who never claimed that he had done more than
play a very minor part in the epoch-making
drama. Still, Samuel Rice was one of those who
helped to raise the power and name of England to
the loftiest position in Europe&mdash;and, indeed, in the
world.</p>

was appointed to the Corps of Gentlemen-at-Arms; became Ensign

Brigade (4th Division) received no acknowledgment of their services
in the Waterloo campaign, their absence from the battle debarring
them from obtaining the battle honour for their colours. But the
officers and men were granted the medal, and took their share of the
prize-money voted by Parliament.</p></div>

November 1813), Captain Phelps held on too long, and was cut off.
He then ran for it, but the Frenchmen discharged their muskets at
him, surrounded him, and took him prisoner. Even then he would
have been bayoneted but for the timely arrival on the spot of the
French officer. By a miracle, none of the shots fired at him had
taken effect, though several bullets had passed through his clothes
and cap.</p></div>

<p>"Major MacMunn belongs to that class of soldiers who have not only moved
in the mid-current of action, but are also fortunately possessed of the gift of
turning their experience to legitimate literary account. It was only natural
that he should join the band of brilliant soldier-authors whose contributions
have so long been one of the special features of 'Blackwood.'... And he has
not only written well himself; he has been the cause of good writing in others,
a gallant exploit of his youth having been celebrated in one of the best modern
military ballads by the late Mr A. H. Beesly. But while it is good to have seen
and done exciting things and to be able to write about them, the mere gift of
narration, valuable as it is, is greatly enhanced when the writer has imagination
and a sense of historic perspective as well. A good many of these stories and
studies are based on experiences which have fallen to the lot of scores of British
officers in the last fifteen or twenty years, on the Indian frontier or in Burma
or in South Africa. But while few could have told them as well as Major
MacMunn, fewer still could follow him in the more difficult task of conveying
the sense of the changelessness of the immemorial East, or of reading in the
present traces of 'old, unhappy, far-off things and battles long ago.'"&mdash;<cite>Spectator.</cite></p>

7s. 6d. net. Illustrated.</p>

<p>This work shows the charm and romance of Indian history, it brings into relief
the great and inspiring characters who have played a part in it, instead, as
so many writers have done, of harping only upon the meanness and cruelty with
which it has been defaced. The best friends of India have longed for such a
book for many years, and will rejoice that it has at last been written. It is as
readable as a novel, and of an interest far exceeding that of most fiction.</p>

<p>"It might have been supposed that our imagination would easily have been
kindled by the story of the splendid princes who gloried and drank deep in the
gardens and marble palaces by the banks of the Jamna.... But a book was
still wanted which would make a wider public appreciate the charm of this
romantic epoch. Such a book has, I think, at last appeared under the title,
'When Kings Rode to Delhi.' The particular merit of Miss Festing is that she
feels the pathos and romance which hang about the crumbling walls of Delhi,
and makes us feel it too."&mdash;Sir <span class="smcap">Theodore Morison, K.C.I.E.</span>, in <cite>Blackwood's

<p class="small u"><b>This new Series would seek to do for Literature what has
already been done by many series of School Readers for
History, Geography, and Science. Many teachers feel that
their pupils should be introduced as soon as possible to the
works of the great writers, and that reading may be learnt
from these works at least as well as from compilations
specially written for the young. Because of recent changes
in Inspection, the present is a specially suitable time for
the Introduction of such a series into Elementary Schools.
In the Preparatory Departments of Secondary Schools the
need for such a series is clamant.</b></p>

<p class="small u"><b>It is to be noted that the books are not manuals of
English literature, but merely Readers, the matter of which
is drawn entirely from authors of recognised standing. All
the usual aids given in Readers are supplied; but illustrations,
as affording no help in dealing with Literature, are
excluded from the series.</b></p>

<p>"The volumes, which are capitally printed, consist of selected
readings of increasing difficulty, to which notes and exercises are
added at the end. The selected pieces are admirably chosen, especially
in the later books, which will form a beginning for a really sound
and wide appreciation of the stores of good English verse and
prose."&mdash;<cite><b>Athenæum</b>.</cite></p>

<p>"The selected readings ... are interesting, and possessed of real
literary value. The books are well bound, the paper is excellent,
and the unusual boldness and clear spacing of the type go far to
compensate for the entire absence of pictorial illustrations."&mdash;<cite><b>Guardian</b></cite>.</p>

<p>A very excellent gradus to the more accessible heights of the
English Parnassus.... The appendices on spelling, word-building,
and grammar are the work of a skilful, practical teacher."&mdash;<cite><b>Pall
Mall Gazette</b></cite>.</p>

<p>"If we had the making of the English Educational Code for
Elementary Schools, we should insert a regulation that all boys and
girls should spend two whole years on these four books, and on
nothing else."&mdash;<cite><b>Bradford Observer</b></cite>.</p>

<p>"The books are graded with remarkable skill."&mdash;<cite><b>Glasgow Herald.</b></cite></p>

<p><b><em>Moira O'Neill</em></b>, Author of 'Songs of the Glen of Antrim,' writing to Mr Blackwood,
says: "F.'s 'Stories of the English' was written for my little daughter Susan. The
child is quite fascinated by it, but equally so are all the grown-up friends to whom
I have shown it. I lent it once to a sailor uncle, and he sat up to all hours of that
night with it, and afterwards told me that he could hardly believe that such an
account of Nelson's great battles had been written by a woman, because it was
technically accurate. And a soldier friend and critic used almost the same words
about the account of Marlborough's campaigns. F. is the most patient and faithful
student of history that I know. She has such a strong literary sense that she simply
could not write anything except in a literary form, and combined with it she has
that rare thing, a judicial mind. This, I think, gives her work a quite peculiar
value."</p>
